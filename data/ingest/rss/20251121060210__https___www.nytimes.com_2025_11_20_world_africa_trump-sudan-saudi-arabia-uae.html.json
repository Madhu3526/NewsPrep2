  "title": "At Saudi Behest, Trump Vows to Seek Peace in Sudan, a Goal He Had Spurned",
  "text": "Until this week, President Trump had viewed the war in Sudan as an insoluble mess, “crazy and out of control,” and not a crisis he wanted to get involved with, as he put it.\n\nBut then a visit by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia to Washington appeared to inspire a conversion in the American president. After a briefing from the Saudi leader on Sudan’s history and culture — as well as its atrocity-filled war — Mr. Trump was sold.\n\n“His Majesty would like me to do something very powerful having to do with Sudan,” he told a forum of business leaders on Wednesday. “We’re going to start working on it.”\n\nMr. Trump has frequently overstated his credentials as a peacemaker, once claiming to have solved eight wars in eight months. But in Sudan, where a disastrous civil war has drawn little Western attention despite creating the world’s greatest humanitarian crisis, his words arrived like a diplomatic thunderbolt.",
  "summary": "It is unclear what President Trump will do to end a brutal civil war in which both sides are backed by U.S. allies, but his statement that he will try has raised hopes for peace.",
