  "text": "Families failed by Covid jabs tell inquiry of pain\n\n15 January 2025 Share Save Sophie Hutchinson Health correspondent Share Save\n\nFamily handout Jamie and Kate Scott on holiday before the pandemic\n\nFamilies of those harmed by Covid vaccines told the UK Covid Inquiry they were forced to support each other during the pandemic because there was no other help. Kate Scott, who represents the group Vaccine Injured and Bereaved UK (VIBUK), said they felt they were \"almost being pushed into the shadows during the pandemic\". The inquiry also heard from a victims' group in Scotland which raised concerns that the vaccine had been rolled out too quickly, and that safety had been sacrificed for speed. This is the Inquiry's fourth module, which will consider issues relating to the development of Covid-19 vaccines and their implementation.\n\nMrs Scott, whose husband Jamie was left severely disabled by a vaccine, said: \"We are an uncomfortable truth, but we are a truth and the truth is for everyone in our group - the vaccine caused serious harm and death.\"\n\nJamie Scott, a father of two boys, worked in a high-powered job until he was severely injured by a Covid vaccine. He spent four weeks and five days in a coma and suffered an extremely rare, life-threatening side effect called VITT, or vaccine-induced immune thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. Jamie survived, but suffered a significant brain injury, which affected his thinking processes. He is now partially blind and his wife says he will never live independently.\n\nfamily handout Jamie Scott while in a coma receiving treatment in hospital\n\nJamie has received £120,000 - the maximum payout from the government's Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme. His wife, who is clear that neither of them is against vaccines, says he will never work again and that this is not a fair or adequate amount. \"The scheme is inadequate and inefficient - offers too little too late and to too few,\" she said. The inquiry heard that figures from a Freedom of Information request by VIBUK show that, as of 30 November 2024, victims and their families have made 17,519 claims to the scheme. Of these: 194 have been notified that they are entitled to the payment\n\n1,027 people have waited more than 12 months for a decision\n\n126 people do not have a decision after waiting three years\n\nPeter Rossiter was a popular music teacher who died after contracting Covid\n\n'I can only imagine the pain you are going through'\n\nCovid Inquiry chairwoman Baroness Heather Hallett spoke with a trembling voice as she told Jean Rossiter, whose son Peter died after contracting Covid-19: \"I too am the mother of two sons of a similar age to Peter, so I can only imagine the pain and the grief that you are going through.\"\n\nPeter Rossiter was a highly talented, classical pianist who brought music to life while head of music in a school, Jean told the inquiry. However, despite being a key worker, he only received his first vaccine in May 2021 - five months after the first jab was given in the UK. That summer he was infected with Covid and became seriously ill, was admitted to intensive care in hospital but died on 11 August 2021.\n\nPeter had kept himself fit, said his mother Jean who helped set up the group Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK. \"He followed the rules, we all did and it seems to us as parents that we did everything right and yet Peter lost his life still, as did so many of the families who're in our group,\" she said. Baroness Hallett said: \"So many people said that Covid-19 only affects the older people. \"You had a fit and healthy young son, under 40, and so it helps to remind people that we are not just about protecting people who some may think have had a good innings; we are about protecting the whole population.\"\n\nThe bereaved families also raised concerns about: delays in some people receiving vaccines\n\npoor communication of the guidance for the public\n\nthe dosage interval - the gap between second and third doses of the vaccine\n\nthe prioritisation of certain groups of people ahead of others",
