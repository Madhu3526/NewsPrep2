  "text": "Advance Metals has wasted no time getting the rods turning again at its high-grade Yoquivo silver-gold project in Mexico, kicking off a fully funded follow-up program to chase recent high-grade hits at depth.\n\nThe new campaign is already under way at the company’s Pertenencia vein area, targeting at least 3000m of diamond drilling that will likely stretch the program into the new year.\n\nAdvance says it is chasing down-dip extensions below the recent stand-out holes from a very successful maiden program earlier in the year that returned 1.1m running 2063 grams per tonne (g/t) silver equivalent from 312m within a broader 4.9m zone running 544g/t silver equivalent Other notable hits that require follow up include 4.4m grading 446g/t and 16.4m at 104g/t silver equivalent.\n\nDrilling underway at Advance Metals’ Yoquivo gold project in Mexico’s world-class Sierra Madre belt.\n\nFresh holes are now stepping out beneath that cluster, while a second batch of collars will see new high-grade regional vein sets tested to the west and southeast of Pertenencia.",
