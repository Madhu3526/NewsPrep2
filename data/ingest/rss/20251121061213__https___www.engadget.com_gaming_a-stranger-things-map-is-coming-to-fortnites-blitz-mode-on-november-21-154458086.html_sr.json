  "text": "The fifth and final season of Stranger Things is almost upon us (well, the first part of it, anyway), which means there are Brand Integrations™ afoot. One of those involves Fortnite and a new map for the fast-paced Blitz mode. Starting on November 21, it seems that you’ll be able to go into the Upside Down for quickfire matches at a creepy version of the Creel House.\n\nThe trailer indicates that there will be skins of several of the main characters available, so you should be able to play as Lucas, Dustin, Mike, Will and Vecna. Other Stranger Things cosmetics will be on deck as well, as leaker FireMonkey revealed a backpack styled after the grandfather clock Vecna uses to terrify some of Hawkins’ residents as well as some emotes. I’m hoping that “Running Up That Hill” by Kate Bush is coming to Fortnite Festival too.\n\nThis isn’t the first crossover between Stranger Things and Fortnite. Skins of Jim Hopper, the Demogorgon and Eleven hit the game all the way back in 2019 alongside season three of the show. Portals styled after those in the series popped up in Fortnite too, but it’s neat that there’s a full-on Stranger Things map in one of the core game modes this time.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollaborations have been an increasingly integral aspect of Fortnite for a years and the current season is hardly an exception. Epic Games turned the island into a cel-shaded version of Springfield for Simpsons-themed chaos.\n\nThe next season, which is set to start on November 30, ties into the theatrical release of Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair, which fuses the two parts of Kill Bill together. The season is slated to feature a version of a Kill Bill scene that Quentin Tarantino never actually shot for the films.\n\nThat’s not all on the Fortnite crossover front, of course. Formula 1 cosmetics are hitting the Item Shop today. Meanwhile, it seems the next battle pass will include a skin of The Bride from Kill Bill, as well as Back to the Future cosmetics like a Marty McFly outfit. An entirely new USA-themed island seems to be in store too, as the new season is the first one of Fortnite Chapter 7. Chapters are major annual refreshes for Fortnite Battle Royale.",
