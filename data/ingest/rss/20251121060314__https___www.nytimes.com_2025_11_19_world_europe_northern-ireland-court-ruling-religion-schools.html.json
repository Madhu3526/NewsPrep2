  "title": "Northern Ireland Must Change How Its Schools Teach Religion, Court Says",
  "text": "A court case that began with two parents concerned about the Christian teaching their daughter was receiving at school ended Wednesday with a landmark judgment that could transform the place of religion in schools in Northern Ireland.\n\nThe Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled that the religious curriculum in Northern Ireland’s public schools was unlawful because it promoted Christianity as an absolute truth and did not teach religion in an “objective, critical and pluralistic manner.”\n\nThe court said in its judgment that the curriculum breached the rights of the child, who is now 11, and of her parents, who had challenged the legality of religious education and collective worship at her Belfast elementary school.\n\nThe family, which was granted anonymity by the court, has no religion and is, “broadly speaking,” humanist in its outlook, the court ruling said.",
  "summary": "The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom said Northern Ireland’s public schools must include the study of faiths other than Christianity.",
