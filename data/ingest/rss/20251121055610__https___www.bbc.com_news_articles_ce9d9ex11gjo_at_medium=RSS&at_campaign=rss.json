  "text": "'Fatal cost' of 'toxic No 10' and 'Migration overhaul'\n\nThe papers on Friday are leading on the long-awaited independent report into how the government handled the Covid pandemic. The front page of the Independent reads: \"Fatal cost of Boris's 'chaotic and toxic' No 10: 23,000 dead\".\n\nPandemic delays were responsible for 23,000 deaths, according to the Times. The inquiry, lead by former judge Baroness Hallett, says the UK response to Covid was \"too little, too late\" and led to thousands more deaths in the first wave. The paper adds that 227,000 UK deaths were attributed to Covid during the pandemic.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Boris Johnson is pictured on the front page of the i Paper, which hones in on the report's allegations of a \"toxic, sexist and chaotic culture\" in Downing Street. Lockdowns could have been avoided altogether if action was taken in the \"lost month\" of February 2020, the paper says.\n\nThe criticism levelled at the former prime minister also leads the Guardian, which says the report paints a \"consistent picture of delay, inaction and apparent inability to learn lessons\".\n\n\"Inexcusable,\" declares the Mirror, quoting Baroness Hallet's evaluation of the government response. It says that the \"Partygate PM's 'toxic' administration\" broke its own rules, referencing the Covid scandal that ultimately resulted in Johnson stepping down as an MP.\n\nThe Telegraph leads with the cost of the inquiry, calling it a \"£200m Covid 'I told you so'\". The paper quotes Richard Tice, deputy leader of Reform UK, who denounced the expense to taxpayers and says the inquiry has \"told what we already knew\".\n\nThe impact of lockdowns on British children is the focus for the Mail, which suggests that the education and wellbeing of young people was sacrificed to \"save their elders\". According to the report, the closing of schools and nurseries in 2020 brought ordinary childhood \"to a halt\".\n\nThe Sun reports that a \"Strictly star\" was arrested last month on suspicion of rape. According to the paper, the allegations related to an incident which happened after a BBC event.\n\nMigrants who are high earners or entrepreneurs could be eligible for settlement in as little as three years, the Financial Times reports. The paper says others could be forced to wait up to 30 years, in what Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has declared the \"biggest overhaul of the migration model in 50 years\".\n\nThe front page of the Express is dedicated to its Christmas appeal, which hopes to secure \"life-changing wheelchairs\" for children in partnership with charity Whizz Kidz.\n\nMany of the front pages focus on the latest report from the Covid inquiry.\n\n\"Toxic, chaotic, calamitous\" are three words chosen by the Metro, as it notes that while Boris Johnson was castigated, all of the UK governments were found to have done \"too little, too late\". The Daily Mirror says the former prime minister's handling of the crisis was \"inexcusable,\" as it highlights the finding that he repeated mistakes. The Guardian says the report \"put paid to any delusions that he had the qualities necessary to be a prime minister, let alone one guiding a country through a deadly national emergency.\" The i Paper says any ambitions of a return to political life are now delusional. The Daily Star calls Johnson the \"killer clown.\" The Sun describes the verdicts as predictable, but damning, and says the state must ensure that the mistakes are not repeated in any future public health crisis.\n\nBut some analysis takes a different approach. In its editorial, the Daily Mail - for whom Johnson now writes a column - argues, that \"of course things would have been done better had the politicians involved known then what they know now. But how could they?\" The Daily Telegraph says the \"costliest inquiry in British history tells us what we already knew - that lockdown was not necessary.\" It quotes the cancer specialist - and lockdown sceptic - Professor Karol Sikora as saying the report \"has no scientific credibility at all - just lots of pretty ignorant lawyers and ex-politicians milking the system for fame, fortune and glory.\"\n\n\"It's amazing what £200m worth of hindsight can buy you,\" suggests the Times sketchwriter, Tom Peck.\n\nMany of the papers pay tribute to the Stone Roses and Primal Scream bassist Gary Mounfield - best known as Mani - who has died at 63. The Guardian's music critic, Alexis Petridis, says Mani's funky bass taught indie kids how to dance. The Mirror says he was the soul of the Stone Roses. For the Times, he was the \"beating heart\" of the band. Nodding to one of the band's biggest hits, the Sun says \"you WERE adored, Mani\".",
