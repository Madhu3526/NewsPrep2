  "text": "The videos were rolled out on social media almost like a streaming series. They had cliffhangers, explosions, intrigue and a catchy title: Operation Midas.\n\nBut this was not fiction. Instead, Ukraine’s top anticorruption agencies released the videos over two days to reveal the biggest corruption scandal in Ukraine since Russian troops invaded almost four years ago. Allies of President Volodymyr Zelensky, the agencies said in the videos, embezzled $100 million from the country’s state-owned nuclear power giant.\n\nThe first promotional materials for the series popped up on social media at 10:10 a.m. on Nov. 10. The anticorruption agencies posted photos of stacks of $100 bills and bags of Ukrainian notes, with the hashtags #midas and #exposed.\n\n“Details later,” the announcement said.\n\nThe videos soon followed, every few hours. New characters were introduced with names like Che Guevara, Rocket and the Professor. After a cliffhanger in one video, viewers were told to stay tuned for the next episode.",
