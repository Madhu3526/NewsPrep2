  "title": "Zelensky Under Siege as Corruption Case Shatters Ukraine’s Wartime Unity",
  "text": "As Russian troops and missiles streamed over Ukraine’s borders on the first day of its invasion, President Volodymyr Zelensky took a moment to shake hands with his main rival, former President Petro Poroshenko. The show of unity quieted Ukrainian politics for years and bolstered his wartime leadership.\n\nThat truce is now gone. A sprawling investigation into a multimillion-dollar kickback scheme has implicated close associates of Mr. Zelensky, jolting the country’s politics back to life and weakening the Ukrainian president at home as pressure on the battlefield intensifies.\n\nAs the most significant corruption scandal of Mr. Zelensky’s tenure unfolds, opponents who had lain low are coalescing into the first major anti-Zelensky movement since the invasion began in 2022. These adversaries include Ukraine’s independent anticorruption agencies, opposition parties, political activists and media outlets.\n\nWith the handshake forgotten and the gloves now off, Mr. Zelensky’s critics are speaking in once-unthinkable terms, including accusing presidential allies of betraying the country. Many Ukrainians have reacted with disgust to accusations that his allies enriched themselves while the country’s soldiers are dying in a fight for national survival.",
