President Bola Tinubu postponed his trip to South Africa for the Group of 20 summit to focus on the kidnapping and other security issues, including an attack on a church in central Nigeria on Tuesday, in West Africa’s most populous nation.\n\nThe police initially reported that 25 girls from the school in Maga, Nigeria, in the state of Kebbi, were thought to be missing. They later updated the tally to 24.\n\nOne of the girls who avoided the kidnapping described the harrowing scene.\n\nThe girl, Khadijat Lawal, 15, said in a phone interview that she, her friends and two sisters first woke up to the sound of people talking outside their dormitory. They became alarmed when they heard someone trying to force the door open.",
