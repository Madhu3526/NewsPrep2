  "title": "The kindness of strangers: a woman cleaned up my toddler’s vomit – and paid for the paper towel",
  "text": "As a twin mum the work is constant. It is double the love and double the laughs, but also double the illness. Of course, my twins would never get sick at the same time. As one recovered, the other would start showing symptoms.\n\nOne day, when my girls were three, one had a vomiting bug. She hadn’t thrown up for 24 hours so I took my chance to do a quick run to the chemist to stock up on supplies. My husband worked away during the week, so I had to manage on my own. I was exhausted, carrying the sick kid in my arms, while walking the healthy one along next to me as quickly as I could.\n\nThe next thing I know, my supposedly healthy kid stops and vomits all over the floor in the middle of the shopping mall. In a small miracle we were, at least, just near the chemist.\n\nWithout hesitation, a lady who was walking past in the opposite direction redirected and came towards me. She grabbed some paper towels from the chemist display and started cleaning the floor as I tried to console and clean my child. As I went to pay for the roll she waved me away and said she would get it. I thanked her profusely and took my girls home.\n\nMy girls are a blessing, but twins are hard work. You are in the trenches when they are young, and it really does take a village. I was sleep deprived and completely overwhelmed that day, so for that lady to step in and take charge meant the world to me. She appeared like an angel.\n\nThis was 10 years ago now but that gesture has always stuck with me. It still reminds me that there are good people out there who will drop what they’re doing and help you out, if they have the opportunity to.\n\nWhat is the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?\n\nShare your experience What's the nicest thing a stranger has ever done for you?
