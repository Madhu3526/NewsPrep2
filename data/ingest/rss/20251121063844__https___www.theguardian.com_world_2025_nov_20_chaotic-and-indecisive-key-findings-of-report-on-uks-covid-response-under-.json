  "text": "“Too little too late” is the key finding of Heather Hallett’s second report from the Covid public inquiry, which focused on politicians and the decisions they made at important points during the pandemic.\n\nAt 760 pages long, there is no shortage of detail on exactly what went wrong and when in the UK during those tumultuous months in 2020 and 2021, and how the actions of those in the heart of power had severe consequences for millions of people.\n\nHere are the key points from the inquiry’s findings:\n\nThere was chaos in No 10\n\nSome of the report’s strongest criticism was directed at the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, and the “toxic and chaotic culture” of his government during its response to the pandemic.\n\nGiving evidence, the former head of the civil service Simon Case said “good people were just being smashed to pieces”, while others claimed there was a sexist culture where “junior women being talked over or ignored”.\n\nThe inquiry found that Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings “materially contributed to the toxic and sexist workplace culture” and “poisoned the atmosphere in 10 Downing Street”, rebuking him for the “offensive, sexualised and misogynistic language” he used in messages.\n\nJohnson came under fire for not seeking to “restrain or control” Cummings, and for “intentionally seeking to foster conflict and a chaotic working environment”.\n\nThe report concluded: “As a result of the poor culture at the centre of the UK government, the quality of advice and decision-making suffered.”\n\nDecision-making was too slow\n\nThe report is unequivocal in its conclusions around decision-making and how if leaders had acted quicker, lives could have been saved.\n\nIt describes February 2020 as a “lost month” and said that by 12 March 2020 the situation was “little short of calamitous”. If a mandatory lockdown had been imposed a week earlier in March 2020, there would have been about 23,000 fewer deaths, it concluded.\n\nDuring the second wave in September and October 2020, it said Johnson “repeatedly changed his mind on whether to introduce tougher restrictions and failed to make timely decisions”, and that a second lockdown in England could have been “reduced in length and severity” if he had acted quicker.\n\nThe report said that in future emergencies, “interventions must be imposed earlier and ‘harder’ than might be considered ideal”, and recommended central taskforces be created in each nation to help with decision-making.\n\nThe Welsh government was also found to have implemented a two-week “firebreak” lockdown too late and lifted measures too quickly, which contributed to a high mortality rate in the country from August to December 2020.\n\nIn Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, the then first minister, was criticised for her overly centralised decision-making process, in which she held “gold command” meetings with a small group of advisers that “reduced transparency” during the pandemic.\n\nOn Northern Ireland, the report said a politically divided Stormont executive led to “chaotic decision-making” during the pandemic and the country’s response was “deeply divided along political lines and beset by leaks, leading to an incoherent approach”.\n\nVulnerable people weren’t protected\n\nThe report said several key groups who were more at risk from Covid, such as disabled people and people from some ethnic minorities, were not sufficiently protected owing to a lack of data and policy failures.\n\nThe government failed to “act sufficiently speedily to mitigate some risks to disabled people”, the report said, such as by not adding people with Down’s syndrome to the shielded patient list until September 2020.\n\nIt also criticised the redeployment of members of the race disparity unit and the government equalities office to help with the pandemic response, even though it was known from April 2020 that people from ethnic minority groups were at a heightened risk of becoming infected.\n\nMessages were confusing\n\nConfusing messaging to the public was a key theme of the report, with Johnson criticised for his “expressions of over-optimism”.\n\nThe inquiry found that he had “failed to convey a proper sense of caution, thereby undermining his government’s public health messaging” on some occasions, such as when he talked about how he had shaken people’s hands in hospital the day before launching a handwashing campaign.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to First Edition Free daily newsletter Our morning email breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what’s happening and why it matters Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain information about charities, online ads, and content funded by outside parties.

This resulted in reputational damage and modellers being considered “over-pessimistic doom-mongers”.\n\nThe report recommended a training course on “core scientific concepts” for politicians that could be provided at the outset of an emergency.\n\nThere was no support for experts\n\nThe inquiry said it was “striking that the burden of providing advice to ministers fell on the shoulders of a few individuals, especially in the devolved nations”.\n\nScientific experts described their workloads as “excessive” and “relentless”, and the inquiry emphasised how most of them were not paid for their advice, which they had to fit in around their jobs.\n\nThey were also subjected to “threats and intimidation” via social media, emails, phone calls and letters. Chris Whitty, England’s chief medical officer, was assaulted in a park in June 2021. His deputy, Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had never expected his family to be threatened with having their throats cut.\n\nThe inquiry said there was a “real risk that intrusive media coverage, coupled with online abuse, other forms of malicious communication and physical harassment, will dissuade talented people from contributing to the provision of scientific advice”.\n\nUK should prepare for next pandemic\n\nThe report’s recommendations suggested new structures need to be urgently put in place to improve decision-making in any future national emergency.\n\nIt said the response to a future whole-system civil emergency should be coordinated by central taskforces in the UK, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with responsibility for commissioning advice, and there should be more scrutiny of emergency powers such as those used to impose lockdowns.\n\nOther suggestions included better inclusion of experts from the devolved nations in discussions, creating a register of experts who can be drawn upon for scientific advisory groups and creating an online portal for restrictions and guidance in each area.",
