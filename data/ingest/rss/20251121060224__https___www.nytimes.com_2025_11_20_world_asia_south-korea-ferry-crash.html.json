  "title": "Ferry Crashed After Operator Was Distracted by His Phone, Officials Say",
  "text": "Kim Hwang-gyun, the chief investigator of the Mokpo Coast Guard, said on Thursday that it had detained the ferry’s first mate, who was in charge of the ship when it crashed, and its helmsman.\n\nThe ship was last sailing at about 26 miles per hour and crashed less than an hour before its scheduled arrival, according to the coast guard and the vessel-tracking site VesselFinder. Passengers described hearing a violent bang and fearing for their lives as the ferry ran aground.\n\nMr. Kim said the coast guard had charged the two officers and the ferry’s captain with injury by gross negligence, a crime that carries a maximum prison term of five years upon conviction. The coast guard did not identify them, saying only that the captain is in his 60s and the other two officers are in their 40s.\n\nThe first mate, who was in charge of the ferry because the captain was off duty, told investigators that he had been checking the news on his cellphone at a time when he should have been turning the ship away from the islet, Mr. Kim told reporters.\n\nBy the time the ferry approached the rock, it was about two to three minutes too late to avoid it, the coast guard said. The vessel was on autopilot in the area of the accident, even though ships normally steer manually there because the sea channel is narrow, Mr. Kim said.",
