  "title": "Environmentalists Sue to Stop Oil Lease Sales in the Gulf of Mexico",
  "text": "Environmental groups sued the Trump administration on Tuesday over a plan to sell oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. The groups say the sale violates a core environmental law and threatens coastal communities and endangered whales.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, said the government failed to conduct reviews required by the National Environmental Policy Act, a bedrock law that has been in place for more than 50 years. The law, known as NEPA, requires the government to evaluate projects’ environmental and health risks and to study alternatives.\n\nThe federal office that organizes the leases, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which is within the Department of Interior, says it won’t follow the NEPA guidelines and has instead performed its own assessment. The lease sales were mandated by the sweeping domestic policy law signed by President Trump in July, and the bureau determined that NEPA didn’t apply to lease sales put in place by this legislation, according to Alyse Sharpe, an Interior Department spokeswoman.\n\nThe lawsuit said the bureau’s alternative assessment failed to account for the environmental risks or to properly evaluate reasonable alternatives.",
