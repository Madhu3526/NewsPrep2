With the 0.96 update, you can route requests through Microsoft’s Foundry Local tool or the open-source Ollama, both of which run AI models on your device’s neural processing unit (NPU) instead of connecting to the cloud.\n\nThat means you won’t need to purchase API credits to perform certain actions, like having AI translate or summarize the text copied to your clipboard.
