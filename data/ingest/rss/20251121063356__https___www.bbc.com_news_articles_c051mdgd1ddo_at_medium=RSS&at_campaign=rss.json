We can feel more tired than normal, lack energy or find it difficult to concentrate. Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), or \"winter depression\" can affect anyone. For those struggling to stick to their normal daily activites, the NHS advises contacting their local GP. For those with milder symptoms, here are three ways to help you manage the darker days and even embrace them.\n\n1. Focus on what you can do\n\nGetty Images\n\nPsychologist Kari Leibowitz says growing up in the US in a summer-centric town meant she used to view winter as limiting and uncomfortable, but travelling to Norway where some places get almost no daylight in the depths of winter changed her mindset. She found that instead of people succumbing to a darker mood, they embraced their circumstances, finding different hobbies from snow sports to knitting and cooking. \"They're looking at winter as a time of year that's full of opportunities,\" she says. Kari said it taught her that changing your approach to focus on what you can do during this time, rather than what you can't, was surprisingly effective. This could include winter walks, movie nights, cooking a new meal or ice skating. \"So often we only focus on the things that are harder to do in the winter when really there's a whole world of seasonal activities that feel better when it's cold out.\"\n\n2. Accept you need more rest\n\nGetty Images\n\nWith our work and social calendars ticking along as normal, we may wonder why we feel so tired but Kari says we need to accept our bodies need more rest in winter. \"It's actually good not to be as productive or active as you would be during the summer months because our bodies are biologically hardwired for rest during winter,\" she says. Just like animals and plants, she says we should be slowing down and changing our behaviour. Dr Em May Armstrong, a plant researcher, says the key is finding the balance between resting more and becoming too lethargic. She suggests so called \"active dormancy\" - mixing a slower restful lifestyle with activities that still keep us mentally engaged. This could include activities such as knitting, repairing clothes or practices that help get you ready for the year ahead. \"And while that's not as active as, say, travelling or camping, it's just as active in a more restorative way.\"\n\n3. Make plans\n\nGetty Images",
