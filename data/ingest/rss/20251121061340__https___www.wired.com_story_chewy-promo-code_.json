  "text": "Florida-based pet food and product online retailer Chewy has been around for less than 15 years but has quickly become a popular source for everything pet-related. Chewy even has supplies for farm animals, reptiles, fish, and more, carrying over 3,500 brands, including everything from food to medicine to toys. My cat is constantly throwing up (same) and requires Hill’s Sensitive Skin and Stomach, which costs roughly as much as my car insurance every month. I use WIRED’s Chewy coupons to save money so I can spring for the 50-cent instant ramen while she can remain vomit-free. Browse our roundup of verified Chewy promo codes and special offers on Autoship and pharmacy orders, BOGO deals, and more.\n\nGet $20 Off Your First Order With Today’s Chewy Discount Codes\n\nIf you’ve been wanting to see if Chewy is right for you, now's the time to try. First-time users can get a $20 eGift card when they purchase over $49 on their first order at Chewy. Use Chewy promo code WELCOME at checkout to save and see if Chewy’s discounted prices and scheduled auto-ship works for your (and your pet’s) needs. Some exclusions apply. If you’ve never placed an order with their Pharmacy, use Chewy coupon code RX20 at checkout to save 20% on prescription essentials like Simparica Trio, NexGard Plus, Heartgard, and more pet medications.\n\nIf you’re a returning customer, don’t fret. Chewy has rotating deals on a myriad of pet essentials and supplies, like flea guard, treats, litter, toys, and more. Plus, you can get an extra $5 off on the first order made through the Chewy app with promo code APP. You’ll just need to download the app, and input the above code in the box on the checkout screen for $5 off.\n\nSave up to 40% With Top Chewy Coupon Codes and Early Black Friday Deals\n\nChewy is rewarding pet parents with early Black Friday deals that have already begun. Right now, one of the best deals I’ve seen is a promo that when you spend $50, you can get $15 off with Chewy promo code EXOTICS2024. Other deals include 15% to 20% off select fresh pet food and toppers, including freeze dried dog food from Vital Essentials (I, well my cats, tried the freeze dried cat food and LOVED it), Stella & Chewy's, Wellness Bowl Boosters (these were also a hit), and Charlee Bear Necessities food topper. You’ll save 20% with code EARLY20 or 15% with code EARLY15, on eligible items. There is a limit of five items per order and three orders per customer, and the deal ends November 24 at 12:10 am, so make sure to take advantage of this deal while you can.\n\nGet Sitewide Chewy Free Shipping\n\nNew customers can also get free 1-3 day delivery (with real-time tracking technology) on first-time orders over $35, which seriously helps in cutting down the convenience cost of being able to get your 40-lb litter box to your third-floor apartment without having to lug it on the L train yourself (speaking from experience, don’t endure what I’ve had to). Get the convenience without having to pay for it with Chewy coupons for free delivery on all items.\n\nSave 50% With Chewy Coupons and Pet Food Deals\n\nAlready a devoted pet-parent/Chewy member? While often the best Chewy promo codes are reserved for first-time customers, existing customers can score daily deals like buy 3, get 1 free offers on toys. Make sure to stay tuned here, because while our top Chewy promo codes unlock over 20% off, there’s more to look forward to., Expect discount codes still to come like 50% off premium dog and cat food, up to 40% off Flea and Tick medications for fall, and free shipping on $35 easy price to hit when you’re grabbing pet essentials (not to mention I’ll spend any amount to not lug around boxes of concrete clay litter in the pits of hell, aka the subway).\n\nGet 55% Off Your First Chewy Autoship Order\n\nDo we have any equestrians in the house tonight? If so, you’re in luck. You can get 40% off horse joint health supplements with Chewy promo code EQSUP.\n\nSurprisingly, some deals don’t require you to apply a code or lift a finger. When you set up an autoship subscription on products you’ll get 35% off your first order, and up to 50% off featured pet food brands; along with an additional 5% off all future deliveries.\n\nChewy lets shoppers combine autoship with other brand-specific deals or category discounts (they just need to be listed on the “Today’s Deals” page). Plus, Chewy makes it easy: you can pause, skip, or cancel any scheduled autoship at any time. You won’t have to be locked in to a subscription and you can adjust frequency as needed, from weekly to monthly and more. And there are even extra discounts for autoship orders on pharmacy items like important prescription medication.\n\nSave on our Favorite Chewy Tech Products\n\nI’m sort of the cat tech guru around here, and have tested a myriad of the best pet tech like automatic feeders and automatic litter boxes, and I have some very strong opinions about which are worth the money (or not). I’m currently using—erm, my cats are using—the Litter-Robot 4 automatic litter box, and although it’s pricey, this box has changed my life. Gone are the days of foul smells, scooping, and pouring litter. This little machine does all the dirty work for you so that you can spend more time on cuddles. I also own the LEVOIT Core Pet Care Air Purifier which has been a game changer for me living in a cramped apartment with two giant cats—it really helps to dissipate any smells, pet hair or pesky dander. I feel like my house overall feels more clean because of this small powerhouse machine. When I transition from WFH I’m going to invest in this inexpensive camera, INSTACHEW Purrsight 360 Degree Wi-Fi Security Pet Camera, to keep an eye on the goings on and shenanigans while I’m at work.",
