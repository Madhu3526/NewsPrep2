  "text": "For up to two hours each day this summer, Mekalah El-Amin massaged her scalp in hopes of increasing hair growth and density.\n\nUsing her fingers or an electric, hand-held massager — changing its position every few minutes so no area was neglected — she would gently rub her scalp with the hopes of stimulating her curly coils from their follicles.\n\n“For the sake of content and my own personal research, let me dedicate a stretch of time to see what works,” Ms. El-Amin said in a phone interview from her home in Los Angeles, referring to her TikTok account, where she regularly shared her progress.\n\nMore people are focusing their attention on their scalps to combat itching and dryness and to increase hair density. They’re turning to TikTok tutorials, pricey serums containing peptides, ceramides and hyaluronic acid and are even visiting head spas for a microscopic look at their hair follicles. (Some people are even traveling to Asia to try out these spas.)",
