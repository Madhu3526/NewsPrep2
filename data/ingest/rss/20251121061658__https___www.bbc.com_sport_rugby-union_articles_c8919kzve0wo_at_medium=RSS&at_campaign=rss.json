  "text": "New Zealand have won as many Tests on their autumn tour as Wales have since the 2023 World Cup, yet the All Blacks are the ones under pressure this weekend.\n\nHead coach Scott Robertson has been criticised after his side suffered a 33-19 defeat by England that ended their hopes of a Great Britain and Ireland Grand Slam tour, as it is regarded in New Zealand.\n\nThe All Blacks are second in the world rankings, were pipped to the Rugby Championship title by South Africa on points difference and won against Ireland and Scotland before defeat at Allianz Stadium.\n\nHowever, they are struggling to meet great expectations and a third loss of 2025 leaves them not only needing to beat Wales - but to do so comprehensively and with style.\n\nWales have nothing to lose on Saturday afternoon, while the All Blacks appear to have nothing to gain.\n\nAt the All Blacks' Cardiff Bay hotel, a journalist from New Zealand asked Robertson about the pressure on his team and how he was trying to lift spirits.\n\n\"You are really talking this up,\" replied the head coach with a smile. \"You're quite dramatic, aren't you?\n\n\"We focus on what we could have done better last week and get on with it. There was some really good stuff in there and you look at that.\n\n\"We won every stat, but the scoreboard is the most important one, so how can we get that right?\"",
