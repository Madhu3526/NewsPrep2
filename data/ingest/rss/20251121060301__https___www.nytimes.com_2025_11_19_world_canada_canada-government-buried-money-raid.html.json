  "text": "On Monday, an Ontario appeals court upheld a judge’s ruling that the Canadian government could keep the cash because, even though Mr. Breton was acquitted, prosecutors were able to prove that the money was not lawfully his.\n\nThe appeals court noted that a trial judge found in 2023 that it was “unusual for an average person to have such a large amount of money buried in tubs underneath their property.”\n\nOr, as the trial judge, F. Bruce Fitzpatrick of Ontario’s Superior Court of Justice, wrote: “How many people have that much cash buried in tubs under their property? How many average people have that much money in their bank accounts at any given time? Not a lot in my experience.”\n\nThe way the cash was packaged — in 30 bricks that were marked with the numbers “5” and “10” and contained exactly $5,000 and $10,000 each — was also “consistent with the cash being proceeds of crime, according to expert evidence,” the appeals court said.\n\nThe court also cited expert evidence that $20 bills, by far the most common found in the bundles, were associated with the drug trade, and noted that two bricks of cash found in the tub contained about $60,000 and $40,000, which was “consistent with the price of 1 kg of cocaine in 2009.”",
  "summary": "A court ruled that the hidden cash, which the police found while searching for an illegal gun in Ontario, did not lawfully belong to the man living on the property.",
