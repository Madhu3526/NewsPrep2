The Hague took action in September over \"serious governance shortcomings\" and concerns over the European supply of semiconductors for cars and other electronic goods. In response, Beijing blocked exports of the firm's chips. However, on Wednesday the Dutch government said it would halt its original decision following \"constructive talks\" with Beijing. China said it welcomed the move, adding it was a \"first step in the right direction towards a proper resolution\".\n\nNexperia is a major supplier of basic computer chips to the car industry, and shortages have threatened global supply chains. A shortage of computer chips used in various electronic goods and cars would hugely impact the ability of manufacturers to make their products. The decision by the Dutch government will ease tensions between the European Union and China, which have been mounting in recent months over trade and Beijing's relationship with Russia. Vincent Karremans, economic affairs minister, said that he considered it right to suspend action, made under the Goods Availability Act, ahead of further talks with the Chinese government. \"We are positive about the measures already taken by the Chinese authorities to ensure the supply of chips to Europe and the rest of the world,\" he said in a statement.",
