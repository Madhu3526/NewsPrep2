  "text": "Google Workspace is the modern business world’s de facto productivity suite, and it’s only gotten better over the years. There’s the centralization of Google Docs, Drive, and Gmail, of course, but Google has bolstered its productivity suite with an AI infusion via Gemini, as well as simplified its offerings to work for massive corporations all the way down to individual users. If you want to get the best price, you need a Google Workspace promo code.\n\nThankfully, you’ve landed in the right spot. Google is offering Workspace discounts until the end of 2025, allowing you to save up to 14 percent on a plan for your first three months. You just need to use one of the coupon codes linked above. Google Workspace works for both individual users and businesses, but if you’re just looking for more Drive space and a few extra features, take a look at Google One.\n\nSave up to 14% Off These Google Workspace Promo Codes 2025\n\nNow through the beginning of 2026 (January 1), Google is offering a discount on all of its Workspace plans, including Starter, Standard, and Plus. Regardless of which plan you choose, or when you sign up, you’ll get a discount on your first three months of service as long as your plan starts before January 1, 2026.\n\nThere are some notable differences between each Workspace plan – I’ll dig into them in the next section – but all three plans come with access to the full slate of Workspace apps. You get Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Meet, of course, but even the cheapest Starter plan includes basic access to Google’s other apps, such as NotebookLM and Gemini inside the Workspace suite.\n\nIf you want to save, make sure to click one of the promo codes at the top of this page to secure your discount.\n\nWhat Is the Best Google Workspace Plan?\n\nGoogle offers four different Workspace plans, though only three are relevant for most people. There’s Starter, Standard, and Plus, as well as Enterprise, which is only available if you contact Google’s sales team. There isn’t a minimum number of users on any of the plans, but the bottom three options (Starter, Standard, and Plus) support up to 300 users. If you need more than that, you’ll need an Enterprise plan.\n\nAlthough you have access to all the apps regardless of the plan you choose, there are some important differences, particularly between the Starter and Standard plans. Both include secure storage through Google Drive, but Starter comes with 30GB per user while Standard comes with a massive 2TB per user. Plus bumps that up to 5TB per user. Across all plans, storage is in a shared pool, so each additional user adds to the total pool of storage your organization can use.\n\nGemini is also a big difference between Starter and Standard. Although both have access to the Gemini app, Starter only has Gemini in Gmail and Vids. Standard (and Plus) includes Gemini across the full suite, including in Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, Meet, and Chat.",
