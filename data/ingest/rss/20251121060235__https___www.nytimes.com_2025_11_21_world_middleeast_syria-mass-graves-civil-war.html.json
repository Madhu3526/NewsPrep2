  "text": "The families of the missing no longer come by the dozens each day to the Najha cemetery, looking for the remains of their loved ones and the closure that could bring.\n\nIn the days just after the dictator Bashar al-Assad was overthrown in December, they would turn up, sometimes with shovels in hand, intent on digging up the mass grave there marked by mounds of overturned dirt. Eventually, they gave up when they realized they would find little more than bones in body bags and no way to determine who they belonged to.\n\nDuring the nearly 14-year civil war, tens of thousands of people seen as opponents of the Assad regime were detained by the former authorities and disappeared, many of them executed or killed under torture, according to human rights groups. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were believed to be hastily buried at the Najha cemetery, which is on the outskirts of the capital, Damascus.\n\nThe fate of the missing is an open wound for relatives who spent years in pained silence, wondering what happened to their loved ones.",
  "summary": "More than 100,000 people disappeared during the 13-year civil war. To bring closure to some of their families, the new government faces the challenging task of exhuming remains from scores of burial sites.",
