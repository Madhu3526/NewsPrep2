  "text": "CloverPit is one of my favorite games of the year so far, and it just arrived on Xbox without prior notice. As revealed during Thursday’s Xbox partner showcase, Panik Arcade’s nightmarish take on the ills of capitalism and gambling is out now on Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. You can play CloverPit via the cloud or the Xbox PC app too, as it’s on Game Pass Ultimate and Premium as well as PC Game Pass.\n\nOn the surface, the game is pretty simple. You’re locked in a rusty room that looks like something out of Silent Hill 2. There are only two ways out: through the door or into a pit. You’ll plummet into the latter if you fail to pay off your rapidly-increasing debt. You’ll be using a slot machine to try to earn enough money to keep your run going.\n\nAs you do with poker hands in Balatro, the whole idea is to bend the rules of the slot machine in your favor using an array of totems and other perks (the developers say they don’t actually like gambling). There are more than 150 items to experiment with. As in many roguelites, finding synergy between them is key.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nCloverPit is a blast. Figuring out a great combination of items and swapping others in as needed is what the game is really all about. There’s nothing quite like going from getting a few coins on a single spin to millions in no time at all. Panik Arcade nailed the one-more-run feeling that’s core to a good roguelite. It’s not much of a surprise that the studio and publisher Future Friends Games have sold more than a million copies of the game on Steam in just a few months, and now console and cloud players can see what all the fuss is about.\n\nPanik Arcade also took the opportunity to tease a CloverPit expansion, which is coming soon on Xbox and Steam. Matteo Gonano, one of the game’s two developers wrote in an Xbox Wire post that the Unholy Fusion DLC “will let players combine charms in wild, experimental ways to create brand-new synergies and chaotic new combos. It’s both an expansion and an invitation to break the game – all over again!“\n\nI thought I had broken free from this dopamine generator. I thought I’d have a lot more time to check out all of the other games I want to. But as soon as that DLC drops I’ll be diving right back into CloverPit, ready to hear that “let’s go gambling!” voice line many, many more times.",
