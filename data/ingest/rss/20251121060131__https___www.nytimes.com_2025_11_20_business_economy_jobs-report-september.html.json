  "text": "Employers notched a respectable month of hiring in September, ending a slow summer on a positive note and assuaging some concern that the labor market had tipped into a contraction.\n\nBut the data were not unequivocally positive: The unemployment rate edged up to 4.4 percent, suggesting that more people were looking for work and not finding it.\n\nDelayed by six weeks because of the government shutdown, the report is an already out-of-date picture of a labor market that had been sputtering in the face of federal layoffs and erratic tariff policies. The Labor Department is set to release numbers for October and November next month, after the Federal Reserve next meets to consider whether to cut interest rates.\n\nThe mixed signals sent by the September report, which is also out of step with some private-sector indicators, may only muddy the waters further.",
  "summary": "The unemployment rate rose in September as more people looked for jobs, according to data delayed by the government shutdown.",
