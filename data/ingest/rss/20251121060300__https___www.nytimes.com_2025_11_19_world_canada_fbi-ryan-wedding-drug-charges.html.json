  "text": "The search for a former Canadian Olympic snowboarder accused of being a cocaine kingpin intensified on Wednesday as senior officials from the F.B.I. and U.S. Department of Justice announced new charges against him and several associates.\n\nThe authorities believe the athlete, Ryan James Wedding, who they say joined forces with the powerful Sinaloa cartel, is in hiding in Mexico. He is accused of running one of the world’s most prolific drug-trafficking organizations and is Canada’s dominant distributor of cocaine, said Pam Bondi, the attorney general, at a news conference.\n\nMore than 35 people have been indicted in the case, which has left behind a trail of deaths, including a man who was supposed to testify against Mr. Wedding and was killed in Medellin, Colombia, in January.\n\nAnother killing involved a couple in their 50s who the police say were misidentified by shooters and killed in November 2023 in a home in Caledon, Ontario. The police said they believed the house had been targeted because of a dispute over a stolen drug shipment.",
