(PTI Photo)\n\nPoll strategist Prashant Kishor’s Jan Suraaj, which failed to open its account in the Bihar Assembly, on Saturday acknowledged that the party’s vision of presenting a new alternative to the people of Bihar had failed to resonate with voters. Despite their best efforts, the party’s attempt to offer a different political narrative had not found widespread support, party’s national president Uday Singh said at a press conference on Saturday.\n\n“We are deeply disappointed by the results, but we are not disheartened,” Uday Singh said. “It’s clear that our message did not reach voters the way we intended. We were trying to bring a new kind of politics to Bihar, but the people did not understand our vision. We, too, failed to communicate effectively.”",
