The media is termed the fourth pillar (of democracy). Although it’s not a statutory position, it still has a significant responsibility in a democracy. The primary job of the media is to maintain the integrity of the legislative, executive and judicial institutions,” said CM Saha.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark the National Press Day in Agartala, Saha stressed the need for media persons to combat the ‘trend’ of the dissemination of partially accurate facts, online hate speeches, and divisive strategies on social media.\n\n“It’s a challenge indeed to spread accurate news and to create a proper environment,” the CM said.\n\nTerming media persons as “mirrors of society”, Saha urged them to work with a sense of responsibility.\n\nHe stated that freedom of speech and expression is the life force of the media, and media persons should be alert about the need to maintain the integrity that comes with presenting news.\n\nCM Saha urged senior journalists to conduct seminars on different topics at least once every month and assured them of extending cooperation through the state’s Information and Cultural Affairs department.\n\nStory continues below this ad\n\nIn reference to the murders of two journalists in Tripura – Shantanu Bhowmik and Sudip Datta Bhowmik – during the erstwhile Left Front regime, CM Saha stated that efforts are being made to ensure justice for them.\n\nBhowmik was killed in September 2017, while Datta Bhowmik was murdered in November of the same year.",
