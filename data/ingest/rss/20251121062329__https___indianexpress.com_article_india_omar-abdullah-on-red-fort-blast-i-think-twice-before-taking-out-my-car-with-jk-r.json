  "text": "A week after the car explosion in Delhi’s Red Fort area that claimed 13 lives, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah on Wednesday said the people of the union territory are apprehensive about travelling to other states as they are all seen as suspects for the violent acts of a few.\n\n“In the prevailing circumstances, perhaps parents will not like to send their children outside. When we are looked at with suspicious eyes from every side, when attempts are made to defame us for someone else’s doing, when attempts are made to bring everyone into the ambit of what few people have done, then it is obvious that it becomes difficult for us to leave for outside,” news agency PTI quoted Omar Abdullah as saying at an event in south Kashmir’s Kulgam.",
