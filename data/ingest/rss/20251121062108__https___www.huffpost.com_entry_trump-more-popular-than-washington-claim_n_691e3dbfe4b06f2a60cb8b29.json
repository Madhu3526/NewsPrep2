  "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nPresident Donald Trump once again insisted the 2020 election was rigged on Wednesday, leaning on one of his most questionable claims about his own popularity in the process.\n\nThe president has had a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad last few days in the news cycle — so, while speaking at the Kennedy Center on Wednesday, he chose to praise the way his administration handled the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“We did a great job with COVID, but that was a horrible thing for the whole world,” Trump said. “The whole world suffered. Your countries suffered. Everybody suffered.”\n\nTrump then noted how the pandemic affected him in unique ways, especially when it came to his poll ratings. The president told the audience that the day before he was told about the incoming pandemic, his pollsters shared some incredibly positive news.\n\n“They said, sir, if George Washington and Abraham Lincoln came back from the dead and they aligned, and they went for the president, vice president as a combination, you’d be beating them by 25 points,” Trump said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut things changed quickly, according to the president.\n\n“And then the next day I was told that something strange is happening,” Trump said. “There’s a lot of death being reported in a certain country. I won’t tell you which one because that country is well represented here.”\n\nYou can see him make the claim below.\n\nTrump: My pollsters said, 'sir, if George Washington and Abraham Lincoln came back from the dead and they went for the president, vice president as a combination, you'd be beating them by 25 points.' pic.twitter.com/SyYsPjwUv6 — Republicans against Trump (@RpsAgainstTrump) November 19, 2025\n\nAlthough it’s theoretically possible that pollsters told Trump he was more popular than Washington and Lincoln, a CNN analysis noted in 2019 that if Trump is heard telling an anecdote where someone calls him “sir,” it’s “very likely to be wrong.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat hasn’t stopped him from making the Washington / Lincoln claim a few times, such as in 2021 and in 2022.\n\nBut while Trump keeps singing the same old song, it doesn’t seem to be landing with the same impact it might have four years ago, based on social media responses.\n\nNow, all that remains is for him to beat Yahweh, Zeus, Jupiter, and Brahma. — ϽΓΣⱤẛ∁ (@CholericCleric) November 19, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFollowup questions: The name of the pollster who told you this? And what poll are they referring to? — The Rob Archer🎙️ (@RobArcher) November 19, 2025\n\nImagine being so fragile you need fake pollsters to tell you you’d beat George Washington and Abraham Lincoln by 25 points.\n\nNot “I’ll fix healthcare,” not “I’ll protect kids from predators” — just “I’m more popular than the guys who literally built the country.”\n\n\n\nThis isn’t… — AnatolijUkraine (@AnatoliUkraine) November 19, 2025\n\nClassic Trump spin, painting even legends as competition he’d crush. Do you buy that or just typical bravado? — nat die (@direumatteul) November 19, 2025\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow odd that Trump thinks his two caretaker are pollsters. — The Possum Politic (@PossumPolitic) November 19, 2025\n\nHe boasted this morning how modest he is——-Seth Meyers’ or Fallons’ comedy skit writers could not come up with material funnier than this shit—his narcissism is metastatic now—it has spread to every cell in his deteriorating body — Dr. Terry DVM—🇨🇦❤️🇺🇦🌊 (@seastar3549) November 19, 2025\n\nTrump’s job approval rating is currently at 43.1%, according to RealClearPolitics.",
