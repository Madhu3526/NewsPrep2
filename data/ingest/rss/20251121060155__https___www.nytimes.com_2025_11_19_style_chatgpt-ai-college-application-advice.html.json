  "title": "Do You Use A.I. for College Application Advice?",
  "text": "The college application process can be dizzying. High school students have long sought advice from family members and school counselors, Reddit forums and pricey admissions consultants.\n\nNow, some young people are turning to a different kind of sounding board: A.I. chatbots.\n\nI’m interested in hearing from students who have used A.I. to help them navigate the college admissions process. Have you consulted a chatbot to research schools you might want to attend, or to assess your chances of admission? Have you asked for guidance about crafting a strong application?\n\nI’m interested in how students are using A.I. as a kind of virtual admissions counselor — not as a ghostwriter to draft their essays for them. (As my colleague Natasha Singer has reported, that’s probably not a great idea.)\n\nI’d love to hear what made you turn to a chatbot, and how confident you felt in the reliability of its responses.",
