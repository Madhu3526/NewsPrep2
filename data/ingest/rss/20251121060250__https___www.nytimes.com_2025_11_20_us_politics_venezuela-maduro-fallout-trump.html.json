  "text": "On Monday, Mr. Trump said he was open to speaking with the Venezuelan leader but would not rule out a ground invasion to support his stated goal of stopping the Maduro government’s complicity in drug trafficking into the United States.\n\nSince early September the U.S. military has conducted at least 21 strikes on boats near Venezuela’s coast, killing at least 83 people who the Trump administration says were carrying drugs toward the United States.\n\nVenezuela’s Nobel Prize-winning opposition leader, María Corina Machado, stands ready to replace Mr. Maduro, who is widely seen as having stolen a 2024 presidential election that Ms. Machado’s movement easily won. Ms. Machado says that she would assume power with a popular mandate and a transition plan ready to implement on Day 1.\n\nBut analysts warn that the troubled recent history of U.S. regime-change interventions in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya could play out again in a post-Maduro Venezuela.\n\n“The thing that really worries us is that they don’t appear to have any serious plan for what happens afterward,” said Phil Gunson, a senior analyst at the International Crisis Group and the author of a new report on the subject.",
