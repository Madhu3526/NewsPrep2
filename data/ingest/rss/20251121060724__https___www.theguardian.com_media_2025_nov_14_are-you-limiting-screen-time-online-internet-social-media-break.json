  "text": "Are you bored of AI slop dominating news feeds? Fed up of “enshittification”? Tired out by “advice pollution”? Done with polarising content? Giving up social media and rediscovering the joy of boredom?\n\nOne study shows that time spent on social media peaked in 2022 and has gone into decline since then, according to an analysis conducted for the Financial Times by digital audience insights company GWI.\n\nLooking at 250,000 adults in more than 50 countries, the analysis found that across the developed world, adults spent 2 hrs 20 minutes a day on social platforms at the end of 2024 on average, nearly 10 percent down since 2022. The largest declines were among young people.\n\nWe want to hear from you. Are you limiting your time spent on social media or deleted some accounts entirely? What have you decided to keep? What prompted the decision and how are you managing it?
