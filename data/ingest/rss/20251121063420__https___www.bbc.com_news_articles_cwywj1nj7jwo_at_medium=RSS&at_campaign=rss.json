The advice came in a strongly-worded letter sent in April 2020 by the chief executive of the Francis Crick Institute, Sir Paul Nurse, and its research director, Sir Peter Ratcliffe, to the then health secretary Matt Hancock. Asymptomatic care home staff were not offered weekly Covid tests until July 2020 in England, with NHS and other social care workers following in November 2020. Matt Hancock is due to appear at the inquiry next week, along with other health ministers from the four nations of the UK.\n\nGiving evidence, Sir Paul, who won the Nobel prize for medicine in 2001, said it was \"disturbing\" that he did not receive a response to his concerns until July 2020. \"For the secretary of state to ignore a letter from two Nobel laureates in physiology or medicine for three months is a little surprising, I would say,\" he told the inquiry. \"Rather than acknowledge they couldn't do it, because that would have indicated a mistake in their overall strategy, they remained silent.\" It was likely that the decision not to routinely test NHS and care home staff led to an increase in infections and deaths in the early stages of the pandemic, he added.\n\nHospitals and care homes\n\nIn the first six months of Covid, there was a frantic drive to increase testing for the disease. Matt Hancock set a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April 2020 in England. By this time it had become clear to scientists across the world that Covid could be spread by people who had not developed symptoms, such as a cough or fever. Sir Paul Nurse, Sir Peter Ratcliffe and their colleague Dr Sam Barrell wrote to Mr Hancock on 14 April 2020 saying they had \"grave concerns\" about \"asymptomatic transmission\" between healthcare staff and patients. \"We advise you that all NHS trusts and healthcare providers should be required to set up surveillance systems for the regular testing of all healthcare workers and patients with immediate effect,\" the letter said. The scientists received a response on 6 July 2020, signed by a junior official in the Department of Health. That reply did not directly address the subject of healthcare workers, instead stating that testing was a \"key part\" of the government's strategy and that capacity was being \"rapidly expanded\".\n\nLighthouse labs",
