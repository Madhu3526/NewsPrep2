  "text": "Among a certain set of women, finding the perfect pair of travel pants is a holy grail. They must be comfortable. They must be easy to wash. They must look relatively sharp, and not schlumpy, when you're in an environment where you could bump into anyone from a pro athlete to your work colleagues. Most of all, they must not drag on the floor of the airplane bathroom. It is such a quest that editor Adrienne So has, for years, referred to a spreadsheet known as the real-life Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, in which women from all over the country that she doesn't even know contribute their thoughts on pants that are reliable, comfortable, and usually black.\n\nAdrienne and I have tested dozens of pairs in airports, on road trips, and in random corners of the world. My favorite travel pants stretch while you run to your gate, breathe while you explore a new city, and are stylish enough to wear out to dinner. They need to be cozy enough for long flights, durable enough to withstand unpredictable weather, and versatile enough to go from airport to boardroom. Here's our roundup of the best travel pants for women that don't compromise on style or comfort for functionality.\n\nFor more apparel and travel recommendations, check out our shopping guides to the Best Hoodies, Best Leggings, and Best Travel Totes.",
