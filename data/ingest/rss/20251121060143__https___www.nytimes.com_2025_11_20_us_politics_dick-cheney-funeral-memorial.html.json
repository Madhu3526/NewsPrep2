  "title": "Cheney Remembered for Transforming National Security and Standing Against Trump",
  "text": "The nation bade farewell on Thursday to former Vice President Dick Cheney, a taciturn man of the West who went from being a lineman for the county to the second most powerful person in the country and dedicated his life to defeating those he saw as enemies of America, at home and abroad.\n\nAt a memorial service much like the man, restrained and proper yet charged with quiet energy, Mr. Cheney was remembered more for who he was than what he did. But his singular role in modern history was undisputed, from helping to shape the nation’s aggressive response to terrorism after Sept. 11, 2001, to standing against President Trump in the twilight of his life.\n\nGathered in the grand Washington National Cathedral was an unlikely mix of Republicans and Democrats who respected him for different reasons. In a sign of how much politics have been turned upside down lately, Mr. Trump, the head of the current Republican administration, was not invited, but Rachel Maddow, the liberal television host who used to skewer Mr. Cheney for spearheading the Iraq war, was on hand as a guest of the family.\n\nNone of the speakers explicitly mentioned the absent Mr. Trump, but his oldest daughter, former Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, alluded to her father’s decision to join her in breaking with the president over his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, which he had lost.",
  "summary": "As the former vice president was honored at Washington National Cathedral on Thursday, many eyes were focused on who came — and who did not.",
