  "text": "For a time, Kellie Sloane’s backers worried there was a stumbling block to her becoming Liberal leader. Could a leader from an electorate that screams privilege really speak to the city’s western suburbs or the state’s regions?\n\nThe party has previously experimented with a leader from Vaucluse, and it failed spectacularly. But was it the name of the electorate or the choice of leader? (Peter Debnam led the Liberals to a loss in 2007, an election even Labor admits should not have gone their way.)\n\nNewly installed NSW Liberal Party leader Kellie Sloane outside Edgecliff station in her Vaucluse electorate. Credit: Dylan Coker\n\nLiberal operatives ultimately landed on Vaucluse not being a major hindrance for Sloane, convinced that her strong communication skills would be able to neutralise accusations of being out of touch.\n\nBut NSW Labor has other ideas – and has been reminding voters at every opportunity that Sloane hails from an electorate home to waterside mansions and the country’s most expensive schools.",
