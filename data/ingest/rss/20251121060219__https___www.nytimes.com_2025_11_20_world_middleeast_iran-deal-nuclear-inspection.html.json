  "title": "Iran Withdraws From Deal for International Nuclear Inspections",
  "text": "Iran said Thursday that it was withdrawing from an agreement to allow a resumption of international inspections of its nuclear sites. The decision came hours after a U.N. watchdog agency demanded information about the status of Iran’s enriched uranium stock and its nuclear sites that Israel bombed in June.\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency, or I.A.E.A., has been unable to inspect Iranian nuclear facilities ever since Israel launched a 12-day war, briefly joined by the United States, that battered Iran’s nuclear and military sites.\n\nPresident Trump declared that Iran’s nuclear enrichment program was “obliterated” in the brief war. But regional officials and experts remain concerned that Iran may have developed a stronger interest in secretly developing an nuclear weapon since the attacks.\n\nIn recent weeks, Rafael Grossi, the head of the I.A.E.A., has said that while Iran does not appear to be actively enriching uranium, there has been renewed activity at some nuclear sites. Uranium enriched at low levels can be used to produce nuclear energy, but at higher levels, it can be used to make nuclear weapons.",
  "summary": "Iran’s foreign minister said his country would halt plans for a reinstatement of nuclear inspections at a time of heightened concern over Iran’s enriched uranium.",
