  "text": "Australia’s internet regulator said on Friday that it would require Twitch, a video livestreaming service, to comply with a coming ban on social media users under 16 years old.\n\nThe ban will take effect on Dec. 10, about a year after Parliament passed one of the world’s most comprehensive measures to protect children and teenagers from potential harm on the internet, such as online bullying and risks to mental health.\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the eSafety commissioner said Twitch had assessed that it met the criteria for the social media ban because online interaction was its core feature. Pinterest, the virtual photo board, was not added to the ban because it did not meet the threshold for interaction, the commissioner said.",
  "summary": "Twitch, a livestreaming service popular with gamers, joins nine other platforms that will be required to remove Australian users under the age of 16.",
