Here is his strategy for gold investors:Gold futures on MCX traded around ₹1,22,624, extending their consolidation as the market struggled to sustain momentum above short-term resistance levels. The recent price action suggests a shift in sentiment toward cautious selling on rallies, particularly as technical indicators begin to show fatigue near the higher band of the recent range.Moving Averages (EMA 8 & EMA 21): The short-term EMA 8 has slipped below the EMA 21, forming a bearish crossover. This indicates weakening momentum, with resistance now placed in the ₹1,22,700–₹1,22,850 zone. Sustaining below this range could invite further downside pressure.Bollinger Bands: Gold prices have retreated from the upper Bollinger band and are now testing the mid-band. This structure signals a cooling phase in the up move, suggesting that rallies are likely to face selling interest near the resistance area.Pivot Points (Previous Day):Gold’s intraday technical setup points to a weakening bias as short-term averages turn negative and momentum oscillators lean lower. Traders are advised to adopt a sell-on-rise strategy near ₹1,22,700–₹1,22,850, keeping a stop-loss at ₹1,23,200 and aiming for downside targets of ₹1,22,100 and ₹1,21,900. A sustained move below ₹1,22,200 may trigger extended selling pressure in the upcoming session.",
