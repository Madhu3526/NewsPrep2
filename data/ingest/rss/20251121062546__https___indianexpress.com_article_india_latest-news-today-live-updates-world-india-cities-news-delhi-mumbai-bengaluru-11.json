The blast almost completely destroyed the car, sources said, leaving only the front portion of the bonnet, a tyre and part of the gear lever intact. “Forensic teams recovered the lower portion of a leg from the driver’s side and sent it to a hospital mortuary for DNA analysis,” sources said.\n\nWhat did the explosive contain? Forensic analysis of explosives that led to the November 10 blast outside the Red Fort has confirmed the use of a mixture of ammonium nitrate and triacetone triperoxide (TATP), highly potent chemicals whose sale and handling are heavily regulated, The Indian Express has learnt. According to the initial findings of the forensic science laboratory, at least 30-40 kg of ammonium nitrate was present in the car, which only could have led to an explosion of such a magnitude.\n\nStay updated with the latest - Click here to follow us on Instagram\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd",
