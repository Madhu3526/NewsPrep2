  "text": "If WIRED doesn’t write about Brooks running shoes more often, it’s because they’re so good and so reliable that it simply doesn’t occur to us. We just buy the next edition of the Brooks Ghost and carry on with our day. Several WIRED writers and editors wear Brooks running shoes as their everyday trainers, and these Brooks Running promo codes are some of the best that we’ve seen all season. As the days get shorter and colder, this is also the perfect time of year to upgrade your winter running gear for waterproof, warmer, brighter, or more compressive clothing to tackle the colder winter months. Winter miles bring spring smiles.\n\nShop the Brooks Running Black Friday Sale\n\nSome of the most popular Brooks Running shoes are on sale for Black Friday, including the Glycerin Max, originally $200, but on sale for $150 during the holiday event. The best-selling running men’s Adrenaline GTS 24 Weatherized are now $110 ($40 off), and the Ghost 16 Weatherized, great for all-terrain and -weather running, are also $110 right now ($40 off). Be sure to check Brooks site for all the best deals on their vast expanse of running shoes.\n\nScore 20% Off Your First Order With Brooks Promo Code\n\nIf you’ve never ordered anything off Brooks’ website before, new customers get 20% off their first order after subscribing to emails. You can apply the one-time Brooks coupon code for top-selling shoes, like the Caldera 7 and Adrenaline shoes, along with other gear and apparel. It’s an easy way to save on some of their top products to take your road and trail running game to the next level.\n\nMore Brooks Coupons and Offers\n\nAre you already a member of Brooks Run Club?

This is a fantastic deal if you only just realized in the past 10 days that you’ve been running in hail in your tiny shorts and cropped sports bra.\n\nSave On Our Favorite Brooks Running Shoes\n\nBrooks makes so many iconic running shoes that it’s hard to list them all. I’m currently running in the Brooks Glycerin Max, which is one of the cushiest shoes that I’ve ever tried. I don’t feel particularly stable on uneven terrain, but the padding is noticeably springy and cushy if you’ve been putting in some serious miles. WIRED director Michael Calore is a fan of the Brooks Ghost line, and if you’re planning on hitting the trails in the cold, wet Pacific Northwest, I would suggest the Brooks Cascadia Gore-Tex. The Adrenaline is the company’s most popular shoe.\n\nUpcoming Brooks Sale Events to Watch Out For\n\nDo you have a runner in your life? The odds are, they’re taking stock of their winter apparel and shoes and trying to decide if these leggings are going to make it through another winter season.
