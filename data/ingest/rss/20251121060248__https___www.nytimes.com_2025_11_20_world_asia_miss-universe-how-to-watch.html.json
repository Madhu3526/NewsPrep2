  "text": "A Miss Universe will be crowned on Friday in Bangkok, marking the end of two weeks of competition that were marred by accusations that it was rigged and rare protests by competitors.\n\nMore than 120 contestants are competing this year, setting a record for a pageant that typically has fewer than 100 entrants. In the past week, they have taken part in the swimsuit and national costume rounds, which will help determine the final 10 contestants.\n\nThe usually quiet weeks leading up to the final were hit by controversy. On Tuesday, one of the eight judges resigned, accusing the organizers of having a second set of judges that selects the finalists in secret. The organizers denied the claim.",
