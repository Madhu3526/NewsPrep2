  "text": "Days after nine people died in an explosion at the Nowgam police station on the outskirts of Srinagar, the Jammu and Kashmir Police said a high-level committee is investigating the incident.\n\nJ&K’s Director General of Police, Nalin Prabhat, had earlier said that the blast was “accidental” and caused by the “unstable and sensitive nature” of the chemicals that were stored in the police station after being seized during an operation in Haryana’s Faridabad. The chemicals were part of almost 3,000 kg of explosives-making material recovered by the J&K Police during raids against a terror module that is suspected to be linked with the November 10 blast near the Red Fort in Delhi.",
