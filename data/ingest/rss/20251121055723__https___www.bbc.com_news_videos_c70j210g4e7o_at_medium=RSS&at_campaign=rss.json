  "title": "'Quiet, piggy': Trump responds to reporter after Epstein question",
  "text": "When speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on 14 November, President Donald Trump was asked about recently released emails from Jeffrey Epstein which mentioned him.\n\nTrump said he knew nothing about that and said the focus should be on other people named in those emails, including former President Bill Clinton.\n\nAfter a journalist from Bloomberg News tried to ask a follow-up question on Epstein, the president turned to her and said: \"Quiet. Quiet, piggy.\"\n\nThe exchange occurred as calls grew for the US Department of Justice to release files related to its investigation into Epstein, the late financier and convicted sex offender who died in prison in 2019.\n\nOn Sunday, President Trump reversed his position and called for Republicans to vote for a bill that forces the Justice Department to release all of its files related to the Epstein case.",
