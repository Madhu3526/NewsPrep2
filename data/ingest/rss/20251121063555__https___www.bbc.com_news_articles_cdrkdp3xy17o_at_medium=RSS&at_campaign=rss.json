The five-day walkout, which finished on Wednesday morning, took place after talks broke down last week. After the strike ended, Streeting offered to resume talks early next week following a plea from the union to get back to the negotiating table. The BMA has now accepted that offer. Streeting said he was not willing to negotiate on pay, but instead resume the previous talks which were focussed on working conditions, including career progression, exam fees and rotas.\n\nHowever, he warned the union it had lost the government's goodwill because of the latest strike, which finished on Wednesday. Streeting's letter to the BMA on Wednesday said it was \"ironic\" the BMA was asking for talks, pointing out he had never left the negotiating table. The previous talks ended last Tuesday when the union confirmed its five-day walkout was going ahead. It was the 12th strike since spring 2023, but the first under Labour.\n\n'Squandered goodwill'",
