  "text": "Championship leader Lando Norris was fastest in a second practice session at the Las Vegas Grand Prix interrupted and then curtailed by a loose manhole cover.\n\nThe McLaren driver was 0.029 seconds ahead of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc third, 0.161secs off the pace.\n\nBut the interruptions to the session meant a number of top drivers did not get runs on the soft tyre during the session, including Norris' team-mate and title rival Oscar Piastri, Red Bull's Max Verstappen and Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton.\n\nThe manhole cover will likely mean a long night for race officials.\n\nThe problem emerged at Turn 17, the final corner, about 20 minutes before the end of the session.",
