  "text": "Black Friday is arguably the best time of the year to pick up small kitchen appliances like blenders, toaster ovens and air fryers. In the latter category, one of our favorites is on sale right now for a great price. The Ninja DZ401 dual-zone air fryer is down to $180, which is 22 percent off its normal price.\n\nAdmittedly, we have seen this model a bit cheaper in the past, but if you’re on cooking duty for Thanksgiving, you might not have the option of waiting until what could be a deeper discount on Black Friday. And the DZ401 is the perfect air fryer for the holiday season, owing to its trademark dual baskets, which allow you to cook up two completely different foods simultaneously. It takes up a fair amount of space, but it’s worth it if you have a lot of hungry mouths to feed.\n\nThis 10-quart fryer includes a smart cook thermometer and six cooking modes, including air broil, roast and dehydrate alongside the default air fry mode. The spacious baskets are quick and easy to clean, and you’re safe to throw the plates into the dishwasher if they’re particularly messy after cooking up chicken wings or some brownies for dessert.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThe Ninja DZ401 has had the title of best dual-zone air fryer in our buying guide for a long time for a reason. An air fryer like this isn’t for everyone, especially those with smaller kitchens, but for a Thanksgiving dinner you’ll struggle to find better.\n\nA number of other Ninja devices are on sale for Black Friday right now. If you don't need quite as big of a machine, the Ninja Crispi glass air fryer/multicooker could be a better option. It's down to $160 right now.\n\nBlack Friday 2025: All Black Friday deals | Black Friday shopping | Black Friday tech deals | Walmart Black Friday deals | Best Black Friday tech deals | Amazon Black Friday deals | Nintendo Black Friday sale | Target Black Friday deals | Black Friday streaming deals: Sling | PlayStation Black Friday deals | Black Friday TV deals | Black Friday Apple deals |",
