  "text": "Does an ambassador need to be diplomatic?\n\nThe U.S. envoy to Canada doesn’t seem to think so.\n\nPete Hoekstra, a former Republican Representative from Michigan appointed by President Trump to the important diplomatic post, is gaining notoriety in Canada for speaking bluntly about the poor state of relations between the two nations.\n\nLast month he cornered the Ontario representative to the United States and publicly berated him at a formal function over an ad the province took out featuring an anti-tariff speech by President Ronald Reagan.\n\nAnd on Wednesday evening, he doubled down on criticism of the ad and dismissed Canadians’ anger at Mr. Trump’s repeated threats to make Canada the 51st state, which is at the heart of the ruptured relationship between the two allies.\n\nIn his public appearances, Mr. Hoekstra, one of the founders of the Tea Party caucus, seems to faithfully channel president Trump’s rhetoric on Canada.",
  "summary": "Pete Hoekstra’s bluntness is seen as undiplomatic by Canadian officials and interpreted as a way for the Trump administration to turn up the heat as trade talks drag on.",
