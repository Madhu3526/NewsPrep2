  "text": "World number one Judd Trump swept to a 4-0 win over an out-of-sorts Mark Williams in just 48 minutes to reach the semi-finals of the Riyadh Season Snooker Championship.\n\nTrump, who is yet to win a title this term, reverted back to an old cue and looked closer to his fluent best as he rounded off victory with breaks of 100 and 102.\n\nIt was a far cry from his performance in his defeat by Mark Selby in the final of the Champion of Champions four days ago, when he spoke of his struggles since opting to switch to a new cue - with a titanium ferrule rather than a traditional brass one - at the start of the campaign.\n\n\"The experiment with that cue did not succeed. It is hard to play your best when you are trying to find the right cue, but I'm out there battling,\" said Trump.\n\n\"There is still going to be a bit of changing until I find the right cue, it is not perfect at the moment.\n\n\"We are all fortunate just to play snooker for a living. Sometimes it's tough when things are not going your way, but I will keep trying and at some point it will all click again.\"\n\nTrump will face China's Zhao Xintong in the last four on Friday after the world champion compiled four half-centuries during a 4-2 win over Shaun Murphy.\n\nDefending Riyadh champion Mark Allen and Australia's Neil Robertson will contest the other semi-final.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Allen won 4-2 in a hard-fought contest against Scotland's John Higgins.\n\nRobertson, who has already won the Saudi Arabia Masters this season, knocked in breaks of 100, 133, 88 and 76 in a dominant 4-0 victory over Kyren Wilson.",
