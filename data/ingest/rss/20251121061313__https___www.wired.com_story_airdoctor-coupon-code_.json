  "text": "Thanks to the COVID pandemic and seemingly never ending wildfires, air purifiers have become an essential home appliance for overall health. Pretty much every building lets in a lot of particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, and vaporous chemicals. Not to mention off-gassing from indoor plastics, furniture, and paint. It’s important to ensure that the air you’re breathing is clean—from stopping coughs and allergy symptoms to helping us wake up with clearer sinuses and less raspy throats—air purifiers can make all the difference. AirDoctor makes a myriad of efficient air purifiers for every type of home, and we have AirDoctor promo codes and deals to help you save big on clean air.\n\nShop the AirDoctor Black Friday Sale\n\nStarting on November 3, through November 30, AirDoctor will be holding their Black Friday sale, which means heavily discounted air purifiers and more. This includes the AirDoctor 3500 and AirDoctor 2000, which is only $619 and includes free shipping. The best-selling 3500 purifies larger spaces, and the 2000 covers smaller rooms only. There is also a huge discount on the AirDoctor 4000 Essentials Bundle, which is regularly $918, but now is only $601, and includes free shipping. The 4000 is the brand’s newest and most energy-efficient air purifier. It’s made for large living rooms and open concept floor plans.\n\nGet $400 Off With AirDoctor Coupon\n\nWith something as serious as the health of your home, it’s important to act now and stay prepared. We know air purifiers can be pricey, and AirDoctor has made it more accessible for all. In preparation for the launch of their newest air purifying system, the AirDoctor 4000, you’ll get an extra $400 off when you pre-order (a total of $400 in savings instead of $800 under regular pricing). Their sleek design has advanced triple filtration and 360-degree air intake that traps 99.99% of particles, like allergens, smoke, mold, and bacteria.\n\nSave 15% on AirDoctor Filter Combo Packs\n\nWe all know buying in bulk is the cheaper option almost always (See Costco, Sam’s Club, et. al), and purifying your home’s air is no different. AirDoctor has a deal right now, where you’ll save 15% when you purchase a filter combo pack (as opposed to individual filters). There’s no promo code required, either, so all you need to do is add it to your cart and you’re golden.\n\nWhat Does an AirDoctor Purifier Do?\n\nAs mentioned at the top, air purifiers can help clean the air in your home, especially against some of those less-known (or noticed) toxins on top of everyday things like smoke, paint, and pet dander. We know the importance of clean air, and that’s why we’ve set up a handy guide on How to Buy an Air Purifier, including important, but often overlooked points, like how to fit your room to an air purifier and how to best pick out one that will best fit your home’s needs. We also have spent months testing air purifiers, and have rounded up the Best Air Purifiers for your home, including our picks for small or large rooms, and those with built-in fans or heaters.\n\nWe thought the AirDoctor Smart 5500i was the best purifier for PM 2.5 and gases because it captures fine particulates with its HEPA filters and gases with its dual action/carbon volatile organic compound trap filters, all while exchanging the air four times an hour in a 1,000-square-foot space. The purifier also has a handy alert to let you know when it is time to change the filter. There are tons of different AirDoctor options for various sized rooms, so make sure you read our guides and measure your home before purchasing to ensure you have the best AirDoctor air purifier for your space.\n\nBest AirDoctor Air Purifier for Mold and Pets in 2025\n\nAs a cat parent living with someone who suffers from cat allergies, I know just how important an air purifier is to keep your home clean. One of the best air purifiers on the market is the AirDoctor 3500, which is great at tackling mold and pet dander. It’s ideal for medium to large rooms like your bedroom, living room, or kitchen, and it’s on sale for $370 for Black Friday (savings of $280). It’s great for rooms with a lot of odors, as it circulates 630 square feet four times per hour to give you continuous clean air, and it also has 3-stage filtration with UltraHEPA.",
