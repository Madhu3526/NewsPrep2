  "text": "NEW DELHI: If one moment conveyed NDA's triumphant mood at the swearing-in ceremony in Patna after its massive poll win, it was the sight of PM Narendra Modi waving a 'gamcha' to the crowd of happy supporters, many of whom cheerfully responded by swinging their own 'gamchas'.A utilitarian accoutrement in everyday life, especially for the working class, the humble 'gamcha' had its proud moment under the sun courtesy Modi. He often wore it during his campaign, and waved it at jubilant BJP supporters at the party's headquarters on Nov 14 when he delivered his victory speech after NDA's massive win of 202 seats in the 243-member assembly.The gamcha is now part of mainstream Bihari dressing culture and the state's distinct identity, a change many will welcome. Parag Goswami, a professor at Pearl Academy, said Modi understands semiotics of culture and fashion and has tapped into the rural and working class identity by taking to the gamcha. As a political prop, it is a great identity marker and Modi conveys to the masses in states like Bihar and UP that he shares their culture code and symbols, he said.He noted that Modi had often connected with people in a similar manner, be it wearing the Assamese gamosa or vesti and angavastram, both associated with TN. These carry layers of meaning are valuable in populist identity-making.",
