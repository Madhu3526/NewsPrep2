  "text": "The British government announced plans on Thursday to extend the time required for legal immigrants to be granted permanent residency, saying foreign workers would have to “earn” the right to remain in the country indefinitely.\n\nThe proposals are part of a tightening of immigration rules under the center-left Labour government as it tries to counter the rise of Reform U.K., a right-wing populist party that has put cutting immigration at the heart of its identity.\n\nHere’s what to know.\n\nHow would the rules for legal immigrants change?\n\nUnder the current system, most people who come to Britain legally can apply for permanent residency, also known as “settled status,” after five years of living and working in the country.\n\nSettled status — which is roughly similar to having a green card in the United States — allows people to study or work in any job. It also grants expanded access to welfare payments.",
