  "text": "Those fears have come and gone. But today they’re very much back, along with a conversation about what it means to have freedom of thought at a time when technology is literally being implanted in our brains.\n\nLinda, what does that technology look like?\n\nAt the core of this technology is something called a brain computer interface, or B.C.I. These are very small devices that go right on the surface of your brain, where they can pick up neural activity. The data is transmitted via Bluetooth to a computer program, which decodes the information.\n\nIn a sense, they’re hooked up to an artificial intelligence. So the neural network inside your mind communicates with a neural network outside. And through that, we are able to reconstruct people’s intentions — what they would like to say, what they would like to do with their arms or hands, and so on.\n\nAnd how is this technology currently being applied?\n\nYou might have heard of Neuralink, Elon Musk’s company, which has implanted 12 people so far with these devices. But there are many others.\n\nThe implants are geared toward what they call restoration of function. For people with degenerative diseases, or who are paralyzed, or who otherwise have lost important abilities, these implants have been totally revolutionary. These patients can move their hands, type and in some cases, speak again.",
