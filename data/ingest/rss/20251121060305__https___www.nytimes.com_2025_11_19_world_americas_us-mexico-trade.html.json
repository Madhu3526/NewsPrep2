  "text": "Canada had for decades been the biggest buyer of U.S. goods, but it has slowly lost ground to Mexico over the years, and it has had a far more combative economic relationship with Mr. Trump since his second term began. While the Trump administration has imposed steep tariffs on some exports from Canada, Mr. Trump has repeatedly carved out exemptions for Mexico after negotiations with its president, Claudia Sheinbaum, and her representatives.\n\nFrom January to August, the new data showed, the U.S. exported $1.4 trillion worth of goods, with $225.6 billion heading to Canada and $226.4 billion to Mexico. (In 2024, the United States exported $349.4 billion to Canada and $334 billion to Mexico.)\n\n“Today is the inflection point,” said Alfonso Muñoz, an economist at De la Calle Madrazo Mancera, an economic consulting firm in Mexico City. “There is a very high complementarity between the economies of Mexico and the United States.”\n\nThe trend was expected to hold as long as there were no major economic crises or interruptions to the current trade agreement among the United States, Mexico and Canada, Mr. Muñoz said.\n\nBecause of free-trade deals since 1994, the economies and supply chains of North America’s three giants have gradually become more interdependent. But over the decades, Canada’s share of U.S. exports has slowly decreased while Mexico’s has increased.",
  "summary": "For first time in at least 30 years, the United States has exported more to Mexico than Canada, U.S. government data show, in a sign of how much North American trade has consolidated.",
