Renee has a lot of clinical experience working with endurance athletes.”\n\nPerfect beats\n\nCoros heart-rate monitor\n\nBarber also suggests this Coros heart-rate monitor. “It’s incredibly accurate, so you can monitor your progress and see if your cardiovascular health and performance are improving – and it doesn’t aggravate or chafe.”\n\nGo with the flow\n\nOversize organic T-shirt\n\nTo look the part but feel comfortable going from a gym class to lunch or work, Barber loves this T-shirt from Actively Conscious. “The oversized fit is ideal for a flow style class such as yoga or pilates.”\n\nGet a grip\n\nWeightlifting straps\n\nFor someone who loves working out with weights, trainer Dalton Wong recommends lifting straps: “They help reduce strain on your wrists and hands, and improve your grip strength, which can help you lift heavier.”\n\nComfy leggings\n\nLululemon Align leggings\n\n“I spend my working day in fitness clothing, so it’s essential that I’m comfortable,” says Alex Tinney, founder of Flex Pilates. “I want the feeling of a second skin instead of ‘holding me in’. Lululemon is an investment, but the quality is incredible. The Align leggings saw me through the whole of pregnancy.”\n\nPilates page-turner\n\nCaged Lion: Joseph Pilates and His Legacy by John Howard Steel\n\nTinney is also dying to read this book on the German physical trainer and writer Joseph Pilates. “It’s been on the reading list for ages.” Great for a pilates fan interested in the history of the practice.\n\nBand aid\n\nTwo-metre resistance band\n\nTinney also recommends a pilates resistance band. “It’s versatile and compact,” she says, “so can be taken away to the gym or on holiday. It adds support and challenge, and can be used with the majority of pilates mat exercises.”\n\nUpper-body blitz\n\nClimbing peg board\n\nFor fitness coach Dan Roberts, home fitness equipment is top of the wishlist. He rates a peg board as “it’s a far more interesting and challenging option than a standard pull-up bar – great for bouldering training, or for those of us hoping to maintain or improve climbing skills, grip strength or pull-up prowess.”\n\nBag it up\n\nTraining sandbag\n\nRoberts also recommends a 60kg sandbag. “The iconic red Cerberus ones are my favourite – you can drag it like a sled, do a clean and press lift, suitcase walk, squat, throw it over your shoulder – it’s a really fun way of training, plus sandbags fix muscular weaknesses and provide functional strength that barbells and dumbbells can’t replicate.”\n\nStick to this\n\nExtreme extra-wide training grips\n\nRoberts often suggests Fat Gripz to clients. “Add these to any barbell, dumbbell or machine handle, and it makes everything harder. The wide grip means you’ll use a more open hand position, which develops a stronger grip and forearms with every rep. It’s particularly good for improving deadlifts and pull-ups. The blue ones usually work best for women, and for men, the super-wide orange ones.”\n\nTraining aid\n\nMagnetic phone holder\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to The Filter Free weekly newsletter Get the best shopping advice from the Filter team straight to your inbox.

It’s a useful gadget, whether you’re using your phone to learn techniques from YouTube, or being live coached by someone like me.”\n\nSweet relief\n\nPulsio Air massage gun\n\nKira Mahal, personal trainer and founder of MotivatePT, trains four times a week, so she describes herself as “obsessed with recovery, because when it goes smoothly, I get more out of each training session. This pocket-size gadget is a dream for any muscle soreness after a session.”\n\nFor more, read our guide to the best massage guns\n\nA soothing soak\n\nSerotonin soak bag\n\nNeal’s Yard seaweed and arnica bath salts\n\n“Once a week, after an intense workout, I take a bath instead of a shower to promote recovery and relaxation,” says Mahal. “It helps my muscles relax and a great night’s sleep always follows. I always opt for bath salts containing magnesium and natural oils.”\n\nStudio style\n\nLounge flared trousers\n\nReversible tank top\n\nSometimes clothing can be a great workout motivation. “I like to wear outfits that make me feel put together and coordinated,” says Mahal. “I’m not sure if it’s purely psychological, but I feel as if I perform at my highest level when I’m wearing the workout clothes I feel comfortable and stylish in. I love this set by Tala because of its colourways – I’m building my capsule wardrobe with lovely neutral tones at the moment. I also love to support female-founded brands like this one.”\n\nLift off\n\nSpeed rope\n\nIs there a simpler piece of exercise kit? Daniel Davies, features editor at Men’s Health UK, says this skipping rope is “light, fast and doesn’t cost the earth. Perfect for mastering ‘double unders’, it’s a favourite of CrossFit aficionados.”\n\nFitness tracker\n\nWhoop One 5.0 activity tracker\n\nDavies recommends the Whoop One 5.0 activity tracker for anyone wanting to get healthier in 2026. “It’s a behaviour changer,” he says. “I doubt anyone who owns one hasn’t avoided that extra drink or skipped a late-night snack for fear of being reprimanded by tomorrow’s sleep score!”\n\nShoes to choose\n\nTraining shoe\n\n“Your foam-cushioned running trainers have no business being used on a lifting platform or anywhere near a squat rack,” says Davies. “Rad One V2 are versatile training shoes that can weather any workout – running, lifting or Hiit.”\n\nFrom gym to office\n\nKit bag\n\n“If you need a bag that can take you from the gym to the office, inconspicuously blending into either setting, this is big enough for all my training and work gear, has a padded pouch for my laptop and a separate lined compartment for gym clothes, which, after a sweaty workout, the public needs protection from,” says Davies.\n\nSteady as she flows\n\nYoga bricks\n\nYoga instructor Hannah Barrett says these yoga bricks, made from sustainably harvested cork, “last for years and bring a natural, grounded feel to any practice”.\n\nSustainable calm\n\nRefillable candle\n\n“This year I’m leaning towards gifts that encourage rest and ritual,” says Barrett. If you want the same for your yoga practice – or life in general – she suggests refillable candles from Pott. “I love the idea that you keep the handmade ceramic pot for ever and simply refill it when it runs out. It’s beautiful, sustainable, and feels like a daily act of calm.”",
