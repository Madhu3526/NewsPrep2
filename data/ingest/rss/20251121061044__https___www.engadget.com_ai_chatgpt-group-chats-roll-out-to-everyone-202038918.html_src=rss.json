Beyond being able to prompt ChatGPT together and react to each other's messages, the features of group chats appear to be deliberately limited. OpenAI says that the content of group chats aren't stored in ChatGPT's memory, and any person can be removed from a chat by any person, save for the creator.\n\nOpenAI was reportedly working on its own version of a text-based social media feed in April.
