  "text": "As the future of physical media looks increasingly grim, it feels like more and more gaming enthusiasts are turning to the classics, back to a time when buying a game meant actually owning it, and the games themselves were more willing to be complete thoughts rather than endless services. If you know someone who has fallen down the old-games rabbit hole, we’ve rounded up a few retro-themed gift ideas that should delight this holiday season, from video upscalers to portable consoles to vintage wall art.\n\nBest retro gaming gifts\n\nPressman The Oregon Trail Card Game If you’ve never died of dysentery, have you truly ever lived? In the world of retro gaming, Oregon Trail holds a special place in the collective memory. Not just because it was possibly one of the first games people ever played, but it was likely how many of us learned about the struggles of our forefathers — including dysentery. The original game is available online, but for your vintage-game loving giftee, the Oregon Trail Card Game packages all the fun (and diseases) into a format that can be shared (or forced) upon friends around the dinner table. Whether your recipient sees themself as a Banker from Boston or a Farmer from Illinois, all of the game’s classic dynamics are here, preserved in infinite-battery life board game format. Two to six people can play together and they’ll have to work to overcome the many challenges that faced travelers on the trail. The game is rated for players ages 12 and above, which we presume won’t be a problem for someone into a game from the ‘70s. — James Trew, Former Editor-at-Large $19 at Amazon\n\nGameSir GameSir G8 Galileo Mobile Gaming Controller Dedicated handhelds are fun, but you don’t need one to use emulators — your smartphone can work just as well. That said, few retro games were made with touch controls in mind. With a mobile gamepad like the GameSir G8 Galileo, that’s no longer an issue. It’s on the larger side, but the bulk makes it feel closer to a traditional console controller than most other options in this space. All of its buttons, triggers and joysticks feel good and responsive on top of that, and it works immediately with a wide range of phones over USB-C — no fiddling in Bluetooth menus required. You’ll probably need to remove your phone case any time you want to use it, and a smaller pad like the Backbone One is easier to pack for the road. But for settling into a game or two for hours at a time, the G8 should cause less hand cramping. — J.D. $80 at Amazon\n\nWill Lipman Photography for Engadget Analogue Pocket There are almost as many ways to play retro games these days as there are games to play. Or at least, it can feel that way sometimes. In our humble opinion, one of the very best of those is the Analogue Pocket handheld console. Unlike other emulators, the Pocket has a cartridge port and can play any Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance title natively. There is also an adapter for Sega Game Gear games, and options for the Atari Lynx, TurboGrafx-16 and Neo Geo Pocket Color are supposed to be available in time for the holidays. We loved the Pocket when we reviewed it, and not just for its faithful reproduction of classic games on a fantastic modern display. We also loved that the Pocket has music-making software built right in and can easily be played on a TV via a dock (though, that costs extra). If your giftee wants to play games from other systems than those mentioned here, know that there’s a thriving community of Pocket fans that have expanded the range of games it can emulate to include digital backups from systems such as the NES, SNES and Genesis. — J.T. $220 at Analogue\n\nWill Lipman Photography for Engadget 8Bitdo Retro Mechanical Keyboard We’re reluctant to peddle in stereotypes, but if you have a friend or family member that loves retro games, there’s a high chance they’d also appreciate the vintage clickety-clack of a mechanical keyboard. 8-Bitdo, a company known for its popular retro-focused game controllers (recommended elsewhere in this guide) has expanded into console-themed PC accessories, and the Retro Mechanical Keyboard is a lovely gift for the Mario-maniac in your life. Importantly, this isn’t just a solid keyboard for Windows, Mac and Android (although it is that). It’s also not just a great tribute to the design of the Nintendo Entertainment System (although it is also that). The Retro Mechanical Keyboard is a “tenkeyless” (TKL) style keyboard that includes a volume knob, Bluetooth and 2.4Ghz wireless modes and USB connectivity. Best of all, though, are the included, oversized red A and B buttons that your giftee can assign to whatever keyboard feature they like. — J.T. $90 at Amazon Explore More Buying Options $100 at Best Buy\n\nRetroTink RetroTink 5X-Pro Collecting retro consoles is a blast, but most of those systems were designed for old CRT TVs, not modern flat screens. Some recent TVs have legacy inputs for older hardware, and you can use a basic HDMI adapter, but many of those can introduce significant lag and blur. That makes it harder to enjoy all the old games your collector friend hunted down on eBay and (over)paid for. To avoid this, look to an external video upscaler like the RetroTink 5X-Pro. It’s a little black box that can connect to a wide range of retro consoles and instantly make them look sharper on modern HD displays. It can output up to 1440p video (other higher-end options can do 4K), yet it keeps input latency down to a level that only the pickiest players will notice. It also comes with a host of inputs and settings for fine-tuning a console’s image, including several forms of deinterlacing and fairly clean scanlines that deliver a more old-school look. But the beauty of the RetroTink is that it does most of its work behind the scenes, so there’s no need to spend all day tinkering to make an old game look good. Just plug a console in and everything will be pretty much good to go from the jump. — J.D. $325 at RetroTink\n\nMossmouth UFO 50 There are tons of old games you could hunt down for your loved one, so it’s worth checking in with them first and seeing if one is high up on their wish list. If you’re after something new that should appeal to a vintage game lover, though, it’s hard to think of a more fitting pick than UFO 50. This is a compilation of 50 all-new games — not mini-games, but complete things — that are designed with 8-bit sensibilities at heart but, for the most part, aren’t totally beholden to pastiche. All of them are unlocked from the start, and together, they present a remarkable breadth of experiences, from a point-and-click horror adventure to a first-person dungeon crawler to a sports game best described as “Windjammers with katanas.” More than that, they speak to what makes good old games so appealing in the first place: uncompromised ideas, distinct styles and a willingness to play with form. For a collection that’s designed to look old, UFO 50 plays like a breath of fresh air. — J.D. $25 at Steam\n\nThe Game Kitchen Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is another commendable throwback for those in search of a modern game with retro sensibilities. The latest spin-off in a series that started nearly 40 years ago, this is a 2D hack-and-slasher with beautiful pixel art, a rocking soundtrack, varied levels, an endearingly cheesy plot and frantic yet satisfying combat. As Engadget’s Kris Holt aptly termed it, it is a “hell yeah” game, one that’s heavy on adrenaline and demanding without being stubborn. It’s not the longest game, but it should satisfy folks who want to scratch a certain ‘80s gaming itch on today’s hardware. — J.D. $25 at Steam\n\nFAQs\n\nWhy do people buy retro games?\n\nBecause they’re fun! Or because video game companies have generally had a spotty record of preserving their own history — and (legally) saving art, even in a minuscule way, is important. Or because, deep down, collectors just want to stave off the ceaseless march of time and hang onto any way to relive their youth before it dissipates for good. Or because they’re jaded with modern game design and crave shorter, more distinct or altogether different experiences that aren’t being served by today’s market. Or because they want to flip the games they collect for a quick buck on eBay. Or because… well, you get the idea. — J.D.\n\nWhy is retro gaming so expensive?\n\nTo put it simply: supply and demand. Companies aren’t making old games and consoles any more, yet a growing number of gaming enthusiasts want them. And as retro game collecting has grown more popular, sellers have become more acutely aware of how high they can price their goods. Not every retro game costs an arm and a leg, however: Popular games from relatively recent consoles are usually more affordable than lesser-selling titles for older hardware, and you can still find a good bargain every now and then by digging through local yard sales, individual eBay sellers and the like. — J.D.\n\nAre retro games a good investment?\n\nIt depends on how you define “good.” Is it a good idea to buy a bunch of old games in the hopes that their value will skyrocket and make you a tidy profit? No, there’s little rhyme or reason to determining exactly which games will shoot up in value and by how much. There are much safer ways to invest if all you care about are financial returns. Is it a good idea to drop a bunch of cash on 40-year-old video games if you have pressing financial responsibilities? Probably not! But hey, it’s your life. If collecting retro games makes you happy, and you can budget for them within reason, that’s a good thing. Have fun. — J.D.\n\nWhat qualifies as a retro game?\n\nThere’s no set definition for when a video game becomes “retro.” Personally, I think of it as any game that’s at least 10 years old and was originally released on a console that’s two or more generations old (or, for PC games, during that generation). But many others would stretch the timeline back farther, and the growing advent of “live service” games has complicated things. For instance, Grand Theft Auto V was released in 2013, while World of Warcraft arrived in 2004 — are those “retro games” when millions of people still play them today? Maybe not. With games from the ‘90s or earlier, though, the distinction is clearer. — J.D.\n\nCheck out the rest of our gift ideas here.",
