  "text": "More Good Mac Accessories\n\nCourtesy of Anker\n\nThe list above has been carefully curated to include our favorites. But we test so many gadgets! Here are more accessories worth exploring.\n\nAnker MagGo Magnetic Charging Station (8-in-1) for $60: This little orb has three AC outlets, two USB-A ports, and two USB-C ports on the back, while the front is home to a Qi2 wireless charging pad to recharge your phone. It's ideal if you have a lot of gadgets at your workstation that constantly need to be plugged in. The USB-A ports output 12 watts, and the USB-C ports can output 67 watts.\n\nSatechi M1 Photograph: Brenda Stolyar\n\nSatechi M1 Wireless Mouse for $30: This is one of my favorite mice. I've been using it with the MacBook Air (M4), the Mac Mini (M4), and the iPad Air (M3). Although I keep it at my desk most of the time, I also throw it in my bag to travel with because it's so lightweight. The ergonomic design is comfortable in my palm, even after a long workday. The buttons are also responsive, and the scroll wheel is nice and smooth. I also love that the Type-C port is on the front of the mouse, which means you can continue to use it while it's plugged in.\n\nNuphy Halo75 V2 for $130: Even if you have the iMac, which comes with Apple's Magic Keyboard, you can always upgrade to a third-party option, like a mechanical keyboard. If I had the means, I'd buy the Nuphy Halo75 V2 in every color. You can choose from various switches (you can listen to the typing sounds of each one here). I went with Raspberry, which has a creamy sound but offers enough tactile feedback that's comfortable for typing all day. You can connect the keyboard via Bluetooth, 2.4 GHz, or USB-C. I have it in the cute pink (Sakura Fizz), but it's also available in Mojito, Iconic White, Obsidian Black, and Blue Lagoon.\n\nLogitech MX Mechanical Mini for Mac for $160: This is the Mac version of Logitech's MX keyboard. It has a Do Not Disturb key along with the ability to program the function row key with Apple's own apps like Keynote, Photos, Safari, Final Cut Pro, and more. It only comes with tactile quiet switches, which are ideal if you work around other people. They're still satisfying to type on, and it's lightweight and slim enough to travel with, too.\n\nThe Das Keyboard MacTigr for $199: The MacTigr (9/10, WIRED Recommends) has a dedicated Mac layout, a high-quality all-metal build, a two-port USB-C hub, and Cherry MX red switches (that aren't too loud).\n\nCourtesy of Amazon\n\nSatechi Dual-Sided Eco-Leather Deskmate for $28: Satechi's desk mat is made of polyurethane leather that looks pretty and allows for your mouse to glide smoothly over the top. It's dual-sided, too, so you can flip between colors if you want to change it up.\n\nUgreen Revodok Pro 211 Docking Station for $55: This is a mix between a dock and a hub. It comes with three USB ports (one USB-C and two USB-A) that hit up to 900 MB/s of data transfer speeds in testing. It's great if you have a multi-monitor setup at your desk, with the ability to also connect it to a keyboard, mouse, and headphones.\n\nPower up with unlimited access to WIRED.
