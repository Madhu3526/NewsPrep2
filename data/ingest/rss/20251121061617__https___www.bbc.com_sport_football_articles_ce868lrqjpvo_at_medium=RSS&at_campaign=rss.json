  "text": "\"I think the key for Wales was getting the home draw, I feel that with that they won't be too bothered with who they got, they'll feel like at the Cardiff City Stadium they can beat anyone,\" said former defender Danny Gabbidon.\n\n\"Bosnia-Herzegovina is going to be a tough game. Last time we ran into them was for the Euro qualifiers and I remember that being a tough game. They're a good side and an experienced team.\n\n\"You look at the final if we get through that, it's two really tough games with Northern Ireland and Italy. It's always difficult playing against the home nations, they just bring a different vibe, different pressure, a different feel.\n\n\"Italy are a quality outfit who will be looking to qualify. It will be three World Cups they've missed out on if they don't qualify for this one, so they'll be desperate to get to the World Cup.\n\n\"We just wish the game was next month off the back of what we did on Tuesday. With the momentum we have, it's a bit weird to have to wait until March now.\"",
