  "title": "After the Louvre Heist, the Museum’s President Defends Her Tenure",
  "text": "In an interview with The New York Times, one of very few she has done since the heist, the usually reserved Ms. des Cars talked in emotional terms about walking for the first time into the Apollo Gallery after it was plundered and seeing its sliced-open glass cases where the jewels had been displayed.\n\n“It is a wound that I will certainly carry all my life,” she said. She added that the news hit her like a physical blow, and thrust her fist into her stomach for emphasis.\n\nSitting in her art-book-lined office, she defended her four years in the job by pointing out that she had warned for years that security was sorely lacking and was working to get all the needed government buy-ins for an overhaul. But she said security was not her only worry.\n\nThe former palace, whose first building dates back to 1190, is in dire need of renovation and repairs. In late 2023, a water pipe hidden within the walls burst, causing the cancellation of a show. Just this week, another showpiece gallery, this one with Greek ceramics, had to close because of weak beams.\n\nThen there is the problem that most vexes Ms. des Cars’s staff: severe overcrowding by visitors, especially around the Mona Lisa.",
  "summary": "In one of her very few interviews since the museum heist, Laurence des Cars said the plan would increase much-needed security, but critics say it is too focused on new construction.",
