  "text": "Stocks in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan tumbled on Friday, reversing gains from a rally the previous day, as investor anxiety about a potential investment bubble in artificial intelligence bled over to Asia from the United States.\n\nThe Kospi index in South Korea fell more than 3 percent in early trading in Asia on Friday. The losses were driven by declines in South Korean chip companies, including SK Hynix, which plummeted more than 7 percent.\n\nBenchmark indexes in Japan and Taiwan declined more than 2 percent. Advantest, a Japanese manufacturer of semiconductor equipment, was down more than 10 percent, while Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company shed more than 4 percent.\n\nIn recent weeks, investors have been increasingly concerned that tech companies’ lavish spending on A.I. hardware like semiconductors and data centers — which has helped to fuel a rally in A.I.-related stocks over the past three years — might be outpacing actual demand. That has prompted a slump in the shares of many large global technology firms.",
  "summary": "A sharp reversal in Asian stocks, after a rally fueled by Nvidia’s strong earnings, underscores how fears of an A.I. bubble are driving broad market swings.",
