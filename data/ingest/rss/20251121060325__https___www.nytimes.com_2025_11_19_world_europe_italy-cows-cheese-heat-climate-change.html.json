  "title": "The Climate Is Changing, Cows Are Stressed and Italy’s Cheesemakers Are Worried",
  "text": "As a fourth-generation cheesemaker from the Puglia region in Italy’s boot, Angelantonio Tafuno sounds in many ways like just another millennial trying to slow down in a frenetic world.\n\nOn a recent fall afternoon, Mr. Tafuno, 32, preached a more languid lifestyle for farmers and cheesemakers who “are running a little too much.” His goal, he said, was to churn out fewer bulbs of the handmade burrata and mozzarella that his family has been making for decades, while developing specialty aged cheeses that he can produce for just a few months of the year. Behind him, a herd of Podolica cows, a breed of cattle that produces less milk than typical dairy cows, pounded toward a wooded grove to graze for the afternoon.\n\nBut for Mr. Tafuno, who invested in 30 head of the Podolica two years ago, the effort to develop new artisanal formulations represents more than a desire to create a gentler farm-to-table life. Doing more with less has become necessary as climate change endangers his family’s business. Extreme temperatures in Italy linked to global warming have not only contributed to dire droughts and catastrophic fires, they have also caused cows to produce less milk.",
  "summary": "Extreme heat causes cows to produce less milk. This poses problems in cheese-obsessed Italy, especially as it tries to meet growing demand for favorites like burrata.",
