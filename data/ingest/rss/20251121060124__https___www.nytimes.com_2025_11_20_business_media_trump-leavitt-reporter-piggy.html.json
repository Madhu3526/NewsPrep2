  "title": "Trump Calling Reporter ‘Piggy’ Was ‘Frankness,’ White House Says",
  "text": "Last week, President Trump snapped at a journalist when she asked him about Jeffrey Epstein. “Quiet!” the president told Catherine Lucey, a reporter for Bloomberg News. “Quiet, piggy.”\n\nMr. Trump’s use of a schoolyard epithet raised eyebrows. “Disgusting and completely unacceptable,” scolded CNN’s Jake Tapper. A press watchdog group said that “targeting women reporters with humiliating insults should not be tolerated.”\n\nOn Thursday, Mr. Trump’s press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, put a different spin on the remark.\n\n“I think everyone in this room should appreciate the frankness and the openness that you get from President Trump on a near-daily basis,” Ms. Leavitt told reporters during a briefing in the West Wing.\n\nMs. Leavitt, who was asked by a journalist to explain what Mr. Trump had meant when he used the term “piggy,” presented the following logic:\n\n“The president is very frank and honest with everyone in this room. You’ve seen it yourself. You’ve all experienced it yourselves. And I think it’s one of the many reasons that the American people re-elected this president, because of his frankness. And he calls out fake news when he sees it. He gets frustrated with reporters when you lie about him, when you spread fake news about him and his administration.”",
  "summary": "Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, addressed for the first time a schoolyard insult that President Trump lobbed at a Bloomberg News reporter last week.",
