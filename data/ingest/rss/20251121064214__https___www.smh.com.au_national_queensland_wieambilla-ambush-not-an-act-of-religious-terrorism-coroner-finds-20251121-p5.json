  "text": "The 2022 fatal ambush of police officers in Wieambilla, west of Brisbane, was not an act of religious terrorism but the result of a shared delusional disorder brought on by a belief that the shooters were experiencing the end of days, Queensland’s state coroner has found.\n\nConstables Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold, along with neighbour Alan Dare, were killed by religious fanatics and conspiracy theorists Nathaniel, Gareth and Stacey Train on December 12 of that year.\n\nRather than an act of terrorism, State Coroner Terry Ryan found the trio acted “defensively within their delusional framework to defend themselves and their property from what they regarded was an evil advance on them”.\n\nConstables Rachel McCrow and Matthew Arnold were shot dead during the ambush in Wieambilla.
