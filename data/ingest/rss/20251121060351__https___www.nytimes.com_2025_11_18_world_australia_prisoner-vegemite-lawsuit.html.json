  "text": "An Australian man facing life in prison after a murder conviction has sued for the right to Vegemite, the yeasty spread that is treasured in his home country but whose smell is so pungent that prison officials call it a problem for search dogs.\n\nFrom behind bars, the man, Andre McKechnie, is taking on a nearly two-decades-long ban on Vegemite in prisons in the state of Victoria, local news media reported on Monday. In a suit filed in Victoria’s Supreme Court, he claimed the ban denies his “culture as an Australian,” news reports said.\n\nThe lawsuit was condemned by David Southwick, a member of the state Parliament and the minister for police and corrections for the opposition. “Victorians are fed up with frivolous court cases that waste time and taxpayer money,” he said in a statement on Monday. “Violent offenders shouldn’t be treating our prison system like a hotel.”\n\nMr. McKechnie, who was convicted in a 1994 murder case, said he was refused requests to eat Vegemite in prison, local news reports said. He is seeking declarations from the court, they added, that the state’s corrections department has denied him certain rights under the human rights charter.",
