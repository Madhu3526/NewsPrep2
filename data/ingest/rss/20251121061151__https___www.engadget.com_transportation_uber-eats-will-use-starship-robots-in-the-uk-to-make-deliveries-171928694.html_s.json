These little robo-couriers will only be able to handle deliveries from \"select merchants\" for the time being.\n\nThe robots won't accept tips, for obvious reasons, but customers can still rate their experience via the app. We aren't sure what happens to a particular robot with enough bad ratings. Maybe it gets sent to a farm in the countryside somewhere.\n\nThe service launches in December and the platform says it'll share more information at that date. Uber Eats also says it plans on expanding the operating territory in the near future. To that end, Starship robots are coming to \"additional European markets in 2026\" and more US markets in 2027.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis isn't Uber's first foray into robot deliveries. Uber Eats has used robots from Serve Robotics and Avride in the past to deliver food.",
