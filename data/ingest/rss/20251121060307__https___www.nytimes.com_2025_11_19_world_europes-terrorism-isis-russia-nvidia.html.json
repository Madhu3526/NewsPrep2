  "text": "Terrorism, then and now\n\nA decade ago, covering terrorism linked to Islamist extremism was a big part of my job. In 2015, I wrote about attacks on the Bataclan concert hall and the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. A year later, terrorists killed dozens by driving into Bastille Day celebrations in Nice and a Christmas market in Berlin. In 2017, I covered three attacks in Britain, including a suicide bombing at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England.\n\nMass casualty terror attacks felt like something we’d simply have to learn to live with.\n\nBut then something changed. Today feels very different. Car-ramming and knife attacks by lone wolf actors who call themselves jihadists still make occasional headlines. But it happens less frequently. And we no longer see the kind of sophisticated quasi-military operations that once killed dozens of people at a time.\n\nThere are a number of reasons the era of Bataclan-style terror seems to have faded for now. But we’re still living with its consequences today.\n\nThe end of the caliphate\n\nThere are reasons behind the decline that almost everyone who studies the phenomenon agrees on.",
