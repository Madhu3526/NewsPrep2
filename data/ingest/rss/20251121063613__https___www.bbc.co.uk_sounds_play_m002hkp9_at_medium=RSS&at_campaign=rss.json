Today, the majority of people living with CF in the UK are adults, a testament to extraordinary medical progress. We meet Annabelle who lives with Cystic Fibrosis, and once believed she might not see her 18th birthday. And we hear from Dr Imogen Felton, a respiratory consultant at Royal Brompton Hospital, with expertise in cystic fibrosis, who tells us about the therapies crucial to this extended prognosis. The EDITH trial (Early Detection using Information Technology in Health) is testing how AI can help radiologists identify breast cancer at an earlier stage, transforming the future of diagnosis. We speak to Professor Sian Taylor-Philips, Professor of Population Health at the University of Warwick and co-leader of the trial. In 2024, participation in Run Clubs across the UK surged by 64%. But does running in a group lead to better performance? To find out, James laces up for a jog around Hyde Park with the Monday Mood Booster Run Club and speaks with Arran Davis, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, who’s exploring the links between social interaction and physical activity. Presenter: James Gallagher Producers: Debbie Kilbride, Minnie Harrop & Tom Bonnett Editor: Ilan Goodman Production coordinator: Ishmael Soriano This episode was produced in partnership with The Open University.\n\nProgramme Website",
