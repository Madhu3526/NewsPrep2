  "text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky has been embroiled in Ukraine’s biggest corruption investigation since the start of the war, with members of his inner circle accused of siphoning off and laundering $100 million from the state-owned nuclear power company.\n\nUkrainian anti-corruption agencies exposed the scheme 10 days ago, but they have unfurled the case slowly, revealing information almost every day through wiretap recordings and court testimony. The steady stream of details has fed the sense of a growing scandal that could reach the highest levels of Ukraine’s leadership.\n\nHere’s what we know about the investigation, called Operation Midas.\n\nThe scheme revolved around kickbacks.\n\nAt the heart of the case is Energoatom, the nuclear power company. Investigators said that participants in the scheme had pressured Energoatom contractors to pay kickbacks of 10 to 15 percent.\n\nIf contractors refused, they were denied payments owed by Energoatom, according to investigators. The scheme, they said, exploited a rule under martial law that prevents contractors from collecting debts in court from companies providing essential services, including Energoatom, which covers more than half of Ukraine’s electricity needs.",
