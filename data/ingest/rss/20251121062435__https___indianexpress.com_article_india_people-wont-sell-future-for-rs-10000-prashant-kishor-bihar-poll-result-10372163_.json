  "text": "Prashant Kishor on Tuesday dismissed the Congress’s claim of votes being bought by the BJP for Rs 10,000. The founder of the Jan Suraaj Party said people won’t sell their and their children’s for a paltry amount.\n\n“People are saying voters sold their votes for Rs 10,000. That is not true; people here will not sell their future or their children’s future. If you calculate, Rs 10,000 comes down to Rs 5.5 per day. Who will sell their vote for such an [paltry] amount? But there is a debate going on around this,” Prashant Kishor said.",
