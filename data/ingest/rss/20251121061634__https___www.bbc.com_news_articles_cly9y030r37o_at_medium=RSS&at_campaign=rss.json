Twelve chimneys will surround the ground which will also host different sporting and entertainment events with a retractable roof and moveable pitch. \"The stadium draws upon the proud heritage of the West Midlands – a heritage of industry, ingenuity and growth,\" Wagner said.\n\nThe distinctive chimneys reflect a brickworks that once sat on the site while providing structural support for the roof, with one tower containing a lift to a bar overlooking the city.\n\nBirmingham City The ground will have a retractable roof that can close in 20 minutes and a moveable pitch\n\nThe \"steep bowl\" design aims to amplify the match-day experience for fans with markets, cafes, restaurants and play areas within the ground. The Championship club, celebrating its 150th anniversary, said its ambition is for the new stadium to be completed for the start of the 2030/2031 football season. Former player Jude Bellingham and Arthur Shelby from Peaky Blinders appeared in a film revealing the stadium at the unveiling at Blues fan Steven Knight's Digbeth Loc film studios. The stadium will \"anchor\" the new Sports Quarter which is being led by Wagner, co-founder of Knighthead Capital Management.\n\nBirmingham City Fans can visit shops, cafes and restaurants, the club said\n\nThe club bought the 48-acre former Birmingham Wheels motorsport site in Bordesley in 2024 and said there will be provision for housing and hotels, recreational facilities and green space. Birmingham Sports Quarter - what you need to know In June, chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a £2.4bn investment in West Midlands transport links, with the Sports Quarter at the heart of the masterplan. Wagner is expected to invest up to £3bn with thousands of jobs expected to be created through the project and further investment. \"This is a huge milestone for Birmingham City Football Club, creating a home for the club that reflects our ambition to compete at the highest level,\" Wagner said.\n\n'A region on the rise'\n\nBirmingham City Twelve chimneys have been incorporated in to the design with one becoming a high-rise bar giving citywide views\n\nWagner went on to say \"the iconic design is a statement of intent for the City of Birmingham and the West Midlands, testament to a region that is on the rise.\" Thomas Heatherwick, founder and design director of Heatherwick Studio who is developing the stadium said they hoped to capture the spirit of Birmingham. \"Too often, stadiums feel like spaceships that could have landed anywhere, sterilising the surrounding area. This stadium grows from Birmingham itself – from its brickworks, its thousand trades, and the craft at its core. \"It's also a wholehearted place for the community. The stadium will truly come alive where it meets the ground; a place for play, gathering, and everyday life.\"\n\nBirmingham City The site is the centrepiece of the new Sport Quarter being developed in the city\n\nFollow BBC Birmingham on BBC Sounds, Facebook, X and Instagram.",
