  "text": "Jake Weatherald and presumably Marnus Labuschagne will open for Australia because Usman Khawaja has been off the field at different points late in England’s innings as the visitors collapsed in rapid time.\n\nSimilar to bowlers when they go off the field to tend to injuries or what have you, the rules state you have to be on the field for a certain amount of time to be involved with bat or ball. So Usman has to wait.\n\nThe Aussie camp are saying Usman Khawaja was off the field stretching because he was feeling a bit stiff. Plan was for him to bat at No.3.\n\nHe would have been able to return to the field at 2.21pm local time, but that was after the wicket of Weatherald, so he slots back to four. All happening.",
  "summary": "After all the jabs and jibes the 2025-26 Ashes series is finally here, with the Perth Test set to get under way with first ball at 1.20pm AEDT. Follow all the action.",
