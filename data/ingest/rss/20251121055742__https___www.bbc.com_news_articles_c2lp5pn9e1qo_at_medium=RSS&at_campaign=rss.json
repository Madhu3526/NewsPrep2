Mandatory age checks will be introduced for accounts using chat features, starting in December for Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, then the rest of the globe from January. Roblox has faced criticism for allowing youngsters to access inappropriate content and communicate with adults, and is being sued over child safety concerns in several US states. The launch also comes just ahead of Australia's social media ban for under-16s - the government is under pressure to include gaming platforms such as Roblox.\n\nIn March, the chief executive of Roblox, Dave Baszucki, said in a BBC interview that the company went to great lengths to keep children safe. However he also urged parents to be guided by their own instincts. \"My first message would be, if you're not comfortable, don't let your kids be on Roblox,\" he said. \"That sounds a little counter-intuitive, but I would always trust parents to make their own decisions.\"\n\n'Deliver change'\n\nRani Govender, policy manager for child safety online at the NSPCC, said action had been needed because young people had been exposed to \"unacceptable risks\" on Roblox, \"leaving many vulnerable to harm and online abuse.\" The charity welcomed the platform's latest announcement but called on Roblox to \"ensure they deliver change for children in practice and prevent adult perpetrators from targeting and manipulating young users.\" The platform averaged more than 80 million daily players in 2024, about 40% of them under the age of 13.\n\nRoblox The facial checks uses the device's camera to estimate a user's age\n\nThe UK's Online Safety Act has strict laws for all tech firms specifically aimed at protecting children from online harms. The communications regulator, Ofcom, is responsible for enforcing the act. Anna Lucas, online safety supervision director at Ofcom, said she was pleased about the new age checking measures. \"Platforms must now take steps to keep kids safe, and we're ensuring they meet their responsibilities. There's more to do, but change is happening.\" In the US, Roblox is facing lawsuits in Texas, Kentucky and Louisiana over child safety concerns. Roblox says it will become the first large gaming platform to make facial age verification a requirement for accessing the chat features. Matt Kaufman, chief safety officer for Roblox, told a press briefing the age estimation technology is \"pretty accurate.\" He claimed the system can make close estimates of \"within one to two years\" bracket for users aged between five and 25. Currently it can be used voluntarily by anyone in the world.\n\nUsers who complete the process will be placed into age groups: under nine, 9 to 12, 13 to 15, 16 to 17, 18 to 20 and 21+. Players can only chat with others in similar age ranges, unless they add someone as a \"trusted connection\", which is a feature for people they know. Under-13s will still be blocked from private messages and certain chats unless a parent gives permission. The new approach follows concerns about adults contacting younger players. In a BBC test earlier this year, it was possible for a 27-year-old user and a 15-year-old user on unlinked devices to exchange messages. At the time, Roblox said attempts to circumvent its rules often involved users trying to take conversations to different platforms.\n\nPrivacy and verification",
