  "text": "Google is gradually replacing the outgoing Assistant with Gemini in all of its apps, and now it’s the turn of Android Auto. In the next few months, any Android users who have made the jump to Gemini on their phones will be able to interact with the next-generation AI assistant while driving using natural language.\n\nThe Gemini-ification of Google Maps has already happened, and its new features are also coming to Android Auto. You can do things like ask the AI about restaurants that serve a specific cuisine on your current route, and ask follow-up questions about the menu or its proximity to your destination. From there, Maps can guide you to the restaurant. Gemini lets you ask questions as you would when talking to another human, which theoretically means you can focus more on the road and less on how to construct a prompt that it will understand.\n\nThe same applies to sending messages while driving. Where before, you’d have to say exactly what you wanted to write. You can just give the AI the gist and it will use the relevant information, such as your ETA if you’re meeting someone, and it can add extra details if requested without you needing to restart the message from scratch. Gemini will also summarize grouped messages.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGemini can also access your Gmail account and pick out things like hotel addresses, as well as running you through your unread emails. Other apps you might want to use while driving, such as Calendar, can also be accessed by the more conversational Gemini.\n\nGemini doubles as a DJ of sorts too, and is able to create on-the-fly playlists with specific conditions relating to genre, length or your general mood. You can even ask it to choose songs that fit the current weather outside. It can also act as a tour guide, running you through some facts about a destination, and if you’re on the way to the wedding, Google even suggests practicing your speech in the car. Gemini likely won’t judge you for calling on its services for some last-minute speech-writing either.\n\nAs long as you have the Gemini app on your phone, it should start appearing on your Android Auto-enabled infotainment system. You can either say “Hey Google”, tap the on-screen mic button or press the voice control button on the steering wheel. 45 languages are supported and you can translate any message into a language that Gemini knows in real-time.",
