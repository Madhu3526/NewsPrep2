  "text": "Open Extended Reactions\n\nWeek 12 of the NFL season brings a popular throwback uniform and first-of-its-kind alternate look, but it begins with a clean monochromatic matchup.\n\nThe Houston Texans are wearing their all-battle-red threads on \"Thursday Night Football\" against the Buffalo Bills. The combination debuted last season and features a bullhorn on the all-red helmet and shoulder. Buffalo is appropriately countering Houston's look with all-white threads.\n\nKelly green returns for the Philadelphia Eagles against the Dallas Cowboys. Philadelphia's throwback threads include the classic Eagles logo with wings on the side of the helmet. The Eagles wore the look in Week 8 against the New York Giants and remain undefeated in it since it debuted in 2023. Sunday marks the first time since its return that Philadelphia will wear it for a road matchup.\n\nFor the first time in franchise history, the New Orleans Saints are wearing all-black. New Orleans announced an alternate black helmet in 2022, which hadn't been worn since 1969. Since then, the Saints have paired it with all-white or gold jerseys, which debuted in Week 1 this season. The Atlanta Falcons will don all-white against the Saints.\n\nThe Detroit Lions are also bringing out an alternate look -- they will wear their black threads with a blue helmet to complete the look against the Giants. The Cleveland Browns will don their all-white threads with an alternate white lid against the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nHere's a look at the Week 12 uniforms for all NFL teams, excluding the Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins, Los Angeles Chargers and Washington Commanders, who are on byes.\n\nHelmet: White\n\nJersey: Red\n\nPants: Red\n\nPerry Knotts/Getty Images\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nHelmet: Black\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: TBA\n\nHelmet: Black\n\nJersey: Purple\n\nPants: White\n\nMichael Owens/Getty Images\n\nBuffalo Bills\n\nHelmet: White\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: White\n\nLauren Leigh Bacho/Getty Images\n\nHelmet: Black\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: White\n\nHelmet: Navy\n\nJersey: Navy\n\nPants: White\n\nTodd Rosenberg/Getty Images\n\nHelmet: Orange\n\nJersey: Black\n\nPants: White\n\nJeff Dean/AP\n\nCleveland Browns\n\nHelmet: White\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: White\n\nIan Johnson/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nDallas Cowboys\n\nHelmet: Silver\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: Silver green\n\nCooper Neill/Getty Images\n\nDetroit Lions\n\nHelmet: Black\n\nJersey: Black\n\nPants: TBA\n\nHelmet: Gold\n\nJersey: Green\n\nPants: Gold\n\nAl Bello/Getty Images\n\nHouston Texans\n\nHelmet: Battle red\n\nJersey: Battle red\n\nPants: Battle red\n\nTim Warner/Getty Images\n\nHelmet: White\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: White\n\nHelmet: Black\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: White\n\nCooper Neill/Getty Images\n\nHelmet: Red\n\nJersey: Red\n\nPants: TBA\n\nLas Vegas Raiders\n\nHelmet: Silver\n\nJersey: Black\n\nPants: Silver\n\nCooper Neill/Getty Images\n\nHelmet: Royal/sol\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: Sol\n\nJevone Moore/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nHelmet: Purple\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: TBA\n\nHelmet: Silver\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: White\n\nStacy Revere/Getty Images\n\nNew Orleans Saints\n\nHelmet: Black\n\nJersey: Black\n\nPants: Black\n\nNew York Giants\n\nHelmet: Blue\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: White\n\nMitchell Leff/Getty Images\n\nHelmet: Green\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: Green\n\nSarah Stier/Getty Images\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles\n\nHelmet: Kelly green\n\nJersey: Kelly green\n\nPants: Silver\n\nTerence Lewis/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n\nHelmet: Black\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: Gold\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nHelmet: Gold\n\nJersey: Red\n\nPants: Gold\n\nEzra Shaw/Getty Images\n\nHelmet: College navy\n\nJersey: White\n\nPants: Wolf grey\n\nJustin K.
