  "text": "When Sophie first met her now fiancé, Wales rugby international Dillon Lewis, she felt she had to be up front.\n\nAt the time, she was freezing her eggs - a process she started because of potential fertility issues from her endometriosis.\n\nThe condition means cells similar to those in the lining of the womb (uterus) grow in other parts of the body, which can lead to symptoms including period pain, fatigue, plus pain in the lower tummy and back.\n\n\"It can be very challenging, especially with endometriosis or something chronic, or infertility issues like I've struggled with,\" Sophie said.\n\n\"How do you bring that up to someone new and hope it doesn't scare them away?\"\n\nDespite it feeling uncomfortable, she brought the condition up soon after meeting, meaning on their third date the pair visited a fertility clinic.",
  "summary": "For Sophie Richards those early conversations were just part of the daunting prospect of finding love when you have endometriosis.",
