  "text": "Israel launched an airstrike on a densely populated Palestinian refugee camp in southern Lebanon late Tuesday, killing at least 13 people and wounding several others, according to Lebanese officials.\n\nIt was one of the deadliest Israeli strikes in Lebanon since a cease-fire with Hezbollah went into effect about a year ago, ending a short but devastating war against the Iranian-backed militant group Hezbollah.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had been targeting a training compound for the armed Palestinian group Hamas, near the southern Lebanese port city of Saida. The compound was being used “for training and exercises in order to plan and carry out terrorist attacks” against Israel and its soldiers, the military said.\n\nIt said it had taken steps to mitigate harm to civilians and that it had been “operating against Hamas’ establishment in Lebanon.”",
