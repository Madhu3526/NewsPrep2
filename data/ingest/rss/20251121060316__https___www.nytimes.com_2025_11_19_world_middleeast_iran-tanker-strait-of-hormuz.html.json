  "text": "Iran released a fuel tanker on Wednesday that it had seized in the Strait of Hormuz, leaving the 21-person crew “safe and in good spirits,” according to the vessel’s manager. The fate of its cargo is unknown.\n\nIran seized the vessel, which was headed to Singapore from the United Arab Emirates, on Friday for carrying what it called “unauthorized cargo,” Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Navy said in a statement to state media.\n\nBefore the vessel was seized, it was carrying a cargo of high-sulfur gas oil, which is used primarily as fuel for marine vessels, according to the tanker’s manager, Columbia Shipmanagement, a maritime company based in Cyprus. After its release, the tanker was in “ballast condition,” meaning it had little to no cargo, the company said in a statement.\n\nDebra Edwins, a spokeswoman representing Columbia Shipmanagement, said it was “not in a position to provide commercial details” about what happened to the cargo on the ship, which was sailing with a Marshall Islands flag. The company said in a statement that “no allegations were made against the vessel, her crew and the vessel’s managers and owners” and that it was now free to “resume normal operations.”",
  "summary": "The ship had lost contact with its managers while traveling near Iran on its way to Singapore last week. All 21 members of the crew are safe.",
