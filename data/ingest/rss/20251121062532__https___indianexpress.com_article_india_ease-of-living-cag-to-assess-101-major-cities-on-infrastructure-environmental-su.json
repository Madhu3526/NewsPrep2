Recognising that more than half of the nation’s population will reside in urban areas by 2047 and that quality of urban life is a direct measure of a nation’s progress, we are reinvigorating the audit of urban local governments.\n\nOur audit aims to assess progress under the theme of ease of living in 101 major cities. This audit will examine citizen-centric dimensions such as infrastructure availability, environmental sustainability, and local economic growth. Our findings will provide actionable insights on urban issues, impacting the daily lives of more than 40 crore urban citizens.”",
