  "text": "Liverpool's controversial disallowed goal at Manchester City was correctly not overturned by a video assistant review (VAR), an expert panel has ruled.\n\nHowever the Premier League's Key Match Incidents (KMI) panel, which reviews the big refereeing decisions each week, was split on the decision.\n\nThe five-person panel voted three to two that the on-field decision to disallow the goal was incorrect but also found that VAR was correct not to intervene.\n\nLiverpool captain Virgil Van Dijk thought he had equalised for Liverpool in the 38th minute of the match at Etihad Stadium earlier this month. City went on to win 3-0.\n\nReferee Chris Kavanagh and his assistant Stuart Burt disallowed the goal, ruling that Andy Robertson had committed an offside offence by ducking under the ball on its way to goal.\n\nThe decision, that Robertson's obvious action could have impacted goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma, was supported by the VAR team of Michael Oliver and Tim Wood.\n\nLiverpool made contact with Professional Game Match Officials (PGMO) to raise their concerns, believing the relevant criteria for an offside offence were not met.",
  "summary": "The Premier League's KMI Panel votes 3-2 both that Liverpool's goal should have stood on-field, but didn't reach the VAR threshold.",
