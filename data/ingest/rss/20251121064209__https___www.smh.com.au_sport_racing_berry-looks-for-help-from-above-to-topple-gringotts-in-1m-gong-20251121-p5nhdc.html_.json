  "text": "Tommy Berry knows better than anyone just how hard it will be to beat Gringotts in the $1 million The Gong (1600m) on Saturday, especially if the Kembla Grange track is again hard and fast.\n\nSo Berry, who took Gringotts to a front-running win last year, hopes predicted rain can soften the surface to at least give him a chance to catch the favourite when he guides Kris Lees-trained Tavi Time from a wide gate.\n\nTommy Berry riding Gringotts to victory in the $1 million The Gong last November.

Gringotts’ plan was changed to a run in the Alan Brown Stakes, where Berry was committed to another horse, opening the door for Nash Rawiller to take over. Gringotts was second there before winning the Big Dance again, this time with Berry at Flemington where he finished down the track on More Felons in the Melbourne Cup.\n\n“Not much went right for the whole prep,” Berry said of losing the Gringotts ride.",
