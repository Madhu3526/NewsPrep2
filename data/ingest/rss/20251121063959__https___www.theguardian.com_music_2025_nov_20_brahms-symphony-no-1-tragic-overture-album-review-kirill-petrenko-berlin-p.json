The results may strike some as interventionist, however there’s an organic momentum here that is hard to resist with a pronounced flexibility that, according to the excellent booklet essay, clarifies Brahms’s “furious struggle against the bar line”. Balance is impeccable, although solos seem over spotlighted at times by the recording engineers.\n\nThe Tragic Overture leaps to life with dramatic urgency, its deftly crafted arc one long adrenaline rush. It does, however, sound like it’s been recorded in a more grateful acoustic, avoiding a woolliness in the bass that occasionally afflicts the symphony.\n\nAllow content provided by a third party?
