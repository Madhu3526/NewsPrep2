  "text": "Researchers at Rice University have found that certain atom-thin semiconductors, known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), can physically shift their atomic lattice when exposed to light. This newly observed response offers a controllable way to tune the behavior and properties of these ultrathin materials.\n\nThe phenomenon appears in a subtype of TMDs called Janus materials, named for the Roman god associated with transitions. Their light sensitivity could support future technologies that rely on optical signals instead of electrical currents, including faster and cooler computer chips, highly responsive sensors and flexible optoelectronic systems.\n\n\"In nonlinear optics, light can be reshaped to create new colors, faster pulses or optical switches that turn signals on and off,\" said Kunyan Zhang, a Rice doctoral alumna and first author of the study. \"Two-dimensional materials, which are only a few atoms thick, make it possible to build these optical tools on a very small scale.\"\n\nWhat Makes Janus Materials Different\n\nTMDs are built from stacked layers of a transition metal such as molybdenum and two layers of a chalcogen element like sulfur or selenium. Their blend of conductivity, strong light absorption and mechanical flexibility has made them key candidates for next-generation electronic and optical devices.\n\nWithin this group, Janus materials stand apart because their top and bottom atomic layers are composed of different chemical elements, giving them an asymmetric structure. This imbalance produces a built-in electrical polarity and increases their sensitivity to light and external forces.\n\n\"Our work explores how the structure of Janus materials affects their optical behavior and how light itself can generate a force in the materials,\" Zhang said.\n\nDetecting Atomic Motion With Laser Light\n\nTo investigate this behavior, the team used laser beams of various colors on a two-layer Janus TMD material composed of molybdenum sulfur selenide stacked on molybdenum disulfide. They examined how it alters light through second harmonic generation (SHG), a process in which the material emits light at twice the frequency of the incoming beam. When the incoming laser matched the material's natural resonances, the usual SHG pattern became distorted, revealing that the atoms were shifting.\n\n\"We discovered that shining light on Janus molybdenum sulfur selenide and molybdenum disulfide creates tiny, directional forces inside the material, which show up as changes in its SHG pattern,\" Zhang said. \"Normally, the SHG signal forms a six-pointed 'flower' shape that mirrors the crystal's symmetry. But when light pushes on the atoms, this symmetry breaks -- the petals of the pattern shrink unevenly.\"\n\nOptostriction and Layer Coupling\n\nThe researchers traced the SHG distortion to optostriction, a process in which the electromagnetic field of light applies a mechanical force on atoms. In Janus materials, the strong coupling between layers magnifies this effect, allowing even extremely small forces to produce measurable strain.\n\n\"Janus materials are ideal for this because their uneven composition creates an enhanced coupling between layers, which makes them more sensitive to light's tiny forces -- forces so small that it is difficult to measure directly, but we can detect them through changes in the SHG signal pattern,\" Zhang said.\n\nPotential for Future Optical Technologies\n\nThis high sensitivity suggests that Janus materials could become valuable components in a wide range of optical technologies. Devices that guide or control light using this mechanism may lead to faster, more energy-efficient photonic chips, since light-based circuits produce less heat than traditional electronics. Similar properties could be used to build finely tuned sensors that detect extremely small vibrations or pressure shifts, or to develop adjustable light sources for advanced displays and imaging systems.\n\n\"Such active control could help design next-generation photonic chips, ultrasensitive detectors or quantum light sources -- technologies that use light to carry and process information instead of relying on electricity,\" said Shengxi Huang, associate professor of electrical and computer engineering and materials science and nanoengineering at Rice and a corresponding author of the study. Huang is also affiliated with the Smalley-Curl Institute, the Rice Advanced Materials Institute and the Ken Kennedy Institute.\n\nSmall Structural Imbalances With Big Impact\n\nBy demonstrating how the internal asymmetry of Janus TMDs creates new ways to influence the flow of light, the study shows that tiny structural differences can unlock significant technological opportunities.\n\nThe research was supported by the National Science Foundation (2246564, 1943895), the Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA9550-22-1-0408), the Welch Foundation (C-2144), the U.S. Department of Energy (DE‐SC0020042, DE-AC02-05CH11231), the U.S. Air Force Office of Scientific Research (FA2386-24-1-4049) and the Taiwan Ministry of Education.
