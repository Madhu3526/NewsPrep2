  "text": "On one side of the ​bay​, cruise ships tower above the trees, serving as temporary hotels for thousands of people attending the U.N. climate talks nearby. Ship lights twinkle as diplomats wrestle with how to provide an electricity-gobbling world with cleaner sources of power.\n\nBut j​ust across the bay​ is an utterly different world, one where electricity arrived​ only this year for some. Many more are still waiting for it.\n\nThis is a reality for hundreds of millions of people worldwide who still lack access to power​, one of modernity’s most essential innovations.\n\n“They’re marvelous, aren’t they?” said Joelma Morães Anjo, a lifelong resident of Paquetá Island​, who was admiring the gleaming ships from her home, where reliable electricity was installed about nine months ago. “It’s almost like we’re part of COP​,”​ she said, using the abbreviation for the U.N. talks being held just a few miles away in Belém, a sprawling city on the edge of the Amazon rainforest.",
