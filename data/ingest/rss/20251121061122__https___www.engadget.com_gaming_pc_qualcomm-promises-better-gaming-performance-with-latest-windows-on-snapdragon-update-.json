But with this week's launch of the Snapdragon Control Panel (along with other updates), the company says things are finally looking up for Snapdragon X Elite laptop owners.\n\nAlongside the launch of faster new chips, Qualcomm has made some quality-of-life improvements on the software end. Chief among them is this week's arrival of the Snapdragon Control Panel: the company's answer to NVIDIA and AMD's GPU tools. Like those apps, the Snapdragon software includes familiar features like automatic game detection, per-game settings and Adreno GPU driver updates. On that note, Qualcomm says its drivers have squashed bugs and boosted performance for over 100 games since last year.\n\nQualcomm\n\nThe crucial x86 emulation layer has also gotten some love. Microsoft's Prism Emulator now supports Advanced Vector Extensions (AVX) x86 emulation on Qualcomm chips. Meanwhile, the more advanced AVX2 will be supported out of the box on upcoming Snapdragon X2 Elite laptops. (Expect to hear more about those at CES.) Current Snapdragon X Series devices will receive the update \"in the coming weeks.\"\n\nOne Windows gaming obstacle Qualcomm acknowledged last year was kernel-level anti-cheat tech. At the time, multiplayer games that relied on it simply wouldn't work on its devices. But as part of its gaming announcements this week, Qualcomm highlighted Fortnite's availability. That's thanks to Epic Online Services Anti-Cheat support. Qualcomm says it's also \"working with\" leading anti-cheat providers to add wider multiplayer support. That includes anti-cheat tech from Tencent, Roblox and more.",
