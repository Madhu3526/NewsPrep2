  "text": "Former Arsenal and England forward Kelly Smith says it gives her \"goosebumps\" to see schoolgirls given the opportunity to play football she craved growing up.\n\nThe Football Association (FA) announced on Thursday that their target of 90% of schools in England offering girls equal access to football in PE lessons had been achieved three years ahead of schedule.\n\nThe figure was originally set for 2028 and forms part of the FA's strategy to provide equal opportunities for women and girls to play football.\n\nThe Barclays Girls' Football in Schools network, which began six years ago with 3,000 participating schools, now has 20,202 schools signed up.\n\nThe FA also said that 2.6m girls now have equal access to football in PE - a 31% increase since the 2020-21 season.\n\n\"I was kicked off a boys team for being the wrong sex,\" Smith told the BBC.\n\n\"So it gives me goosebumps thinking about it because now so many girls have the opportunity to play football if they want. In PE, I never had that. I had to fight my way to try and play on a team.\n\n\"We had to change in the car because all the boys changing rooms were taken up with their bags and shirts hanging up.\"",
