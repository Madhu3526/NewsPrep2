The column of ash rose more than 6,500 feet above the peak, according to the Indonesian authorities.\n\nVideos posted on social media and aired by local media showed huge clouds of ash rapidly approaching villages, bridges and farms. In the towns near the mountain, dark gray ash covered homes and streets after the eruption. The volcano also belched large boulders that landed miles away.",
