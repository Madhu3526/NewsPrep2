(File photo)\n\nA group of 272 citizens- including former judges, retired civil servants and senior military veterans have strongly criticised Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, accusing him of venting “impotent rage born out of repeated electoral defeat” and attempting to undermine the credibility of the Election Commission of India (ECI).\n\nIn a joint statement, the signatories said the Leader of the Opposition has repeatedly targeted the Commission with allegations of “vote theft,” using “unbelievably crude language” and even threatening to “hound” officials after their retirement. Despite these public accusations, they noted that Gandhi has not filed a formal complaint supported by the required affidavit, allowing him to avoid accountability for unverified claims and intimidation of public officials, PTI reported.",
