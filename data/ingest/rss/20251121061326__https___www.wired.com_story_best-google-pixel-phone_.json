  "text": "There are some minor multitasking improvements—it's easy to put two apps side by side in split-screen, and you can move the slider in between them to resize the apps, even stow one far to the side for easy access. But you still can't use three apps simultaneously (I miss the OnePlus Open's implementation of this.)\n\nIf you want a folding phone, I suggest looking at the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7, which is thinner, lighter, and easier to use. However, if you prefer Google's software experience and camera quality, there's a good chance you'll really enjoy using the Pixel 10 Pro Fold—if you can stomach the price.\n\nSpecs External display: 6.4 inch, 60 to 120 Hz, OLED, 3,300 nits peak brightness Internal display: 8 inch, 1 to 120 Hz LTPO, OLED, 3,300 nits peak brightness Processor and RAM: Tensor G5 with 16 GB RAM Storage: 256 (UFS 4), 512 GB (Zoned UFS 4), and 1 TB (Zoned UFS 4) Battery: 5,015 mAh Cameras: 48-MP wide, 10.5-MP ultrawide, 10.8-MP telephoto (5X), 10-MP front selfie camera, 10-MP inner selfie camera Updates (from date of manufacture): 7 years Extras: Pixelsnap Qi2 wireless charging, Video Boost, IP68, Google AI Pro Plan, NFC, VPN, Wi-Fi 7, Ultra-Wideband Carrier compatibility: Works on all three major US networks (physical SIM and eSIM)\n\nLast Year's Pixels\n\nYou don't need to buy the latest and greatest! Buying last year's flagship phone is a great way to save some cash. However, make sure you're spending far less than the MSRP—otherwise, you may as well buy one of the latest Pixel 10 phones. The previous Pixel generation from 2024 includes the Pixel 9, Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.\n\nThe Tensor G4 chipset in these phones is perfectly capable, the displays still get very bright, and the cameras aren't vastly different. The Pixel 9 lacks the extra 5X optical zoom camera, and none of these devices have Qi2 support, so no magnetic fun. While Google hasn't confirmed what features from the Pixel 10 series will arrive on the Pixel 9 series, there's a good chance many of them will in a future Pixel Drop feature update.\n\nThe Pixel 9 regularly dips below $550, the Pixel 9 Pro drops to $599, the Pixel 9 Pro XL for $850, and the Pixel 9 Pro Fold has been on sale for $1,350. I wouldn't buy these devices unless they were at those prices again or lower.\n\nThe Best Pixel Cases and Accessories\n\nI've written a broader guide on the Best Pixel 10 Cases and Best Pixel 9 (and 9a) Cases, but here are a few selections for your perusal. We've highlighted cases for the current Pixel lineup, but you can easily find the same versions for prior models if you peruse the case maker's catalog.\n\nThese official cases from Google for the Pixel 10 series are Qi2-certified with Pixelsnap magnets baked in, allowing you to attach the phone to magnetic accessories without any loss in strength or wireless charging capabilities (if you use a case without magnets, it will weaken the strength and disrupt the feature). The soft silicone is pleasant to the touch, and you can color-match it with your Pixel 10 phone to highlight the phone's color. I also like Google's official Pixel 9a case ($30), which is similar, but it doesn't have the magnets inside, as it's not a Qi2 phone.\n\nMous cases are Made for Google certified, and that's especially important with the Pixel 10 series, as it ensures the best compatibility with Pixelsnap. The Limitless is a great all-rounder, with raised edges over the display, clicky buttons, reliable magnets for Qi2, and several design aesthetics you can choose from, including a walnut back or speckled fabric (pictured).\n\nDbrand's Grip case lives up to its name. It has clicky buttons and incredibly grippy edges. It feels robust yet fairly slim, and you can choose a snazzy design. Just know that you have to apply this “skin” to the back of the case. There's a lot of room for error here, so be careful, and watch Dbrand's installation video for tips. There's Pixelsnap support so you can use your Pixel with Qi2 and even MagSafe accessories, and it worked exceptionally well in my testing.\n\nThis is hands-down the best case if you frequently attach your Pixel to the handlebars of a bike or an electric scooter. Peak Design's mounting system lets you magnetically affix the phone to its Universal Bike Mount ($50), and it stays put. After more than a year of testing, I've yet to have a phone fall off my ride using this mounting system. The company also has several other magnetic accessories, like a car vent mount. The case itself is nice; I just wish the edges were raised more for better screen protection. You can choose to have it with the loop, which acts as a grip, or without it.\n\nThis is the best clear case for the Pixel 10 series. Dbrand promises that the Ghost 2.0 won't yellow over time, so much so that if it actually does, the company will replace it for free. It's thin, has stronger magnets than most other Pixelsnap cases, and has grippy edges. And you get to see your Pixel's color shine through. The company technically doesn't make it for the Pixel 10, just the Pro models, but because the dimensions are the same, the 10 Pro case fits perfectly on the Pixel 10.\n\nGoogle's Ring Stand is a surprisingly sturdy and great kickstand. There's good tension in the metal ring, and you can adjust your phone at varying heights. You can also twist it to put the phone in landscape or portrait orientation. Make sure you take it off before placing the phone on a wireless charger; you're not supposed to attach magnetic accessories or chargers to the Ring Stand itself.\n\nYou don't need to spend this much for a decent Qi2 charger, but these are what Google is officially selling, and they're great (if overpriced). The stand version is actually the same Pixelsnap charger, just with a robust stand to keep it propped up. The stand is stable, doesn't shift around, and you can charge the phone in landscape or portrait orientation.\n\nDbrand gives you two screen protectors in this package, and it comes with a super-easy application tool. Wipe down your phone with the included alcohol wipe, dry it with the microfiber, and then place the tool over your phone and pull the pull tab. Press down on the line, wait 30 seconds, and then take the tool off. There's a squeegee to push out air bubbles. If you don't want to spend this much, Spigen's GlasTR tempered glass protectors are also easy to apply and cost $20 for a two-pack.\n\nGoogle's latest Pixel 10 series supports 29W and 39W charging speeds, depending on the model. That makes this 65W a little overkill, but I still think it's a great all-around charging adapter to carry with you. It's incredibly slim and lightweight, has folding prongs, and includes two USB-C ports. When you have two devices plugged in, one port will dish out 45W and the other will deliver 20W. The former will let you hit the fastest charging speeds possible on any of your Pixel devices.\n\nThe Pixel Ecosystem\n\nIf you buy a Pixel phone, there's a good chance you're interested in Google's other Pixel hardware. Good news: They're pretty great. The Pixel Buds Pro 2 are excellent earbuds, and the Pixel Watch 4 is the Android smartwatch to beat.\n\nDenoted as the “Best Earbuds for Android” in our Best Wireless Earbuds guide, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 (9/10, WIRED Recommends) are wonderfully small and compact, with a fun, egg-shaped case that has a lovely matte texture. They pair well with Android devices, have wireless charging, and include excellent noise-cancelling. You can also tap and hold the buds to talk to the Gemini voice assistant, and a recent software update added Loud Noise Protection and Adaptive Audio, the latter of which dynamically reduces the volume of unwanted sounds like sirens. You can even nod to answer a call or shake to decline!\n\nIf you don't want to spend as much, there's also the Pixel Buds 2a ($129), which are even smaller and have many of the same features, though there's no wireless charging in the case.\n\nThe Pixel Watch 4 (8/10, WIRED Recommends) works with all Android phones, and it's a natural fit with a Pixel phone. This smartwatch will relay any app notifications you want to see on your wrist, and you can even check your Nest security cameras via the Google Home app. You can raise your wrist to talk to the Gemini assistant, no hot word needed, and there's a robust suite of health and fitness tracking capabilities that go toe-to-toe with the Apple Watch. Battery life is solid too, lasting about a day and a half with the 45-mm model, and it recharges incredibly fast.\n\nYou can opt for the cellular version if you want always-on connectivity even away from your phone, though you'll need to pay up for a separate watch data plan. Read our Best Smartwatches guide for other options.\n\nOur Favorite Pixel Software Features\n\nPixels have many great software features, but some need to be toggled on. It can also be hard to remember that all these features exist, so here are most of the top ones.\n\nCall Features\n\nThere are some key features on Pixels that you won't find on any other Android phone. Some of these are available only on select Pixels—the Tensor chip started with the Pixel 6, and currently, the Tensor G4 is in the Pixel 9 range. Here's a breakdown:\n\nCall Screen: When you get a call from an unknown number, Google Assistant will scan and flag it if it's suspected spam or a robocall. If it's simply a number you don't recognize, you can have Assistant take the call. You'll see a real-time transcription of what's happening, so you can end the call right away if it's a telemarketer or answer if it turns out to be a long-lost high school friend. If it's someone important, you can give Assistant responses to recite if you're unable to take the call—it offers up contextual replies now, too. Remember to turn it on by opening up the dialer app and heading to Settings (three dots on the top right) > Spam and Call Screen.",
