  "text": "Removing the fish now could prevent them from washing ashore dead again, Mr. Polkinghorne said in a statement. The fish that washed ashore in March, some 5,000 of them, died because of low oxygen in the pond, he said. Regulations in Ontario require all invasive fish captured in storm-water ponds to be euthanized.\n\nThe new efforts may still not be enough to rid the pond of goldfish. “They’re pretty hard to kill,” said Steven Cooke, a biology professor at Carleton University in Ottawa, “and that’s because they do well in places that have poor water quality.”\n\nProfessor Cooke added, “It’s hard to underfeed them, it’s hard to overfeed them.”\n\nGoldfish are an invasive species, originally from Asia. They were once kept in fountains as decoration before becoming a popular pet for children.\n\nThey also breed rapidly. A female goldfish can produce 6,000 eggs and can reproduce more than once a year, he said. Without a large population of predators, goldfish will take over an ecosystem and push out native species, he said.\n\nHe also warned that heavy rainfall could help the goldfish escape the pond. “All of the sudden they get pushed out and now they’re in the river and then they get downstream into other areas,” said Professor Cooke, who says the latest fish estimate is most likely an undercount.",
