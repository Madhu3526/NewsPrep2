  "title": "Are you not being entertained? The decline of the open-play goal",
  "text": "The 301 goals scored in 110 games so far averages out at 2.74 goals per game, which if it continued for the whole season would be the lowest for five years, since 2020-21 (2.69).\n\nBut just 196 goals scored in open play averages out at 1.78 per game and is on course to be the lowest for 16 years, since 2009-10 (1.76).\n\n2009-10 is also the only Premier League campaign to see goals scored more often from non-penalty set-pieces than this season's rate of 0.77 per game (0.79).\n\nSo which teams are most responsible for this change in how goals are scored this season?\n\nIn terms of goals scored from open play, Wolves have seen by far the biggest decline, scoring just four in 11 games, 10 fewer than at this stage last season.\n\nOutside of Wolves, the Premier League's decline in open play goals is very much a London thing, with five of the capital's seven sides scoring at least five goals fewer from open play than last season.\n\nIn fairness, that's largely down to them scoring lots of goals at the start of last season rather than them really struggling to score in open play this campaign.\n\nMeanwhile Manchester City have seen the biggest increase, with all but one of their 23 goals scored this season coming in open play.",
  "summary": "Open-play goals have been on the decline this season and BBC Sport takes a closer look at the trend.",
