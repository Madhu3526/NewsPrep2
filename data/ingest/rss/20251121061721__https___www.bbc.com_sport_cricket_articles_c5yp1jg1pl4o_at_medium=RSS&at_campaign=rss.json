  "text": "Batters on each side of the Ashes divide might be wondering why they are bothering to turn up. A lot of the build-up has centred around the perceived difficulty of scoring runs, particularly for the first Test on a Perth pitch the West Australian newspaper has called a \"green monster\".\n\nWhen it comes to batting in Australia, particularly against pace bowling (we'll come to spin later), no country has been harder in which to score runs over the past five years. There are two reasons for this: pitches and balls.\n\nTaken as a collective, the surfaces prepared in Australia have recently proved to be the fastest, most bouncy and among the most inconsistent in the world. Pace and inconsistent bounce are the perfect recipe for tough batting.\n\nA long-standing narrative from English cricket paints the Kookaburra ball used in this country as a useless tool for a pace bowler. A new version of the Kookaburra was introduced six years ago, resulting in more seam movement - seam is a much bigger weapon than swing in this country.\n\nSince the new Kookaburra was introduced, pace bowlers are averaging 25 runs per wicket in Australia.\n\nTest cricket is about problem solving. When the ball is on top, performances of batters can be the difference, and vice-versa.\n\nIf this Ashes is dominated by the ball, a batter could have the opportunity to be the difference between the two teams.",
