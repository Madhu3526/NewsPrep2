  "title": "Trump Meeting With Saudi Prince Showcased Prince’s Makeover, and America’s",
  "text": "The Oval Office press gaggle on Tuesday with President Trump and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia presented an unusual scene.\n\nThe 40-year-old prince — who at one point had imprisoned his relatives in a Ritz-Carlton hotel — came off as relatively staid and reasonable. After fielding some tough questions with ease, he spent much of the gathering sitting quietly, hands in his lap.\n\nMr. Trump, however, ranted, berating a journalist whose question he said was “insubordinate” and calling the Federal Reserve chairman “a stupid man.” He also raved, telling the prince “what an honor it is to be your friend.”\n\nIt was almost as if, sitting beside a famously authoritarian leader, the president wanted to prove his own mettle. Mr. Trump — who has spoken admiringly of autocrats for decades — reveled in the softball questions tossed by Saudi-owned news media outlets and called for revoking ABC’s broadcast license.",
  "summary": "Mohammed bin Salman was briefly a global pariah after the killing of a Saudi dissident. But he has rebuilt his image as a deal-maker and influential investor.",
