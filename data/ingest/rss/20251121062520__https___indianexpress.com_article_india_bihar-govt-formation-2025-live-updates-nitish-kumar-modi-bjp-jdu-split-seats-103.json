While the RJD suffered losses by sizeable margins in seats where it fielded EBC and non-Yadav OBC candidates, the Congress’s bet on upper-caste candidates failed to yield any reward.\n\nThe RJD’s EBC candidates performed the worst, with the highest average margin of defeat at 27,506 votes. EBCs are traditional voters of JD(U) president and Bihar CM Nitish Kumar .\n\nWhile the RJD contested 143 seats and won 25, the Congress contested 61 seats and won six.\n\nIn the RJD’s list of 143 candidates, 77, or almost 54%, were OBCs, including 50 Yadavs and 27 from other OBC groups. The party had 15 upper-caste candidates and 12 EBCs. The remaining were Scheduled Castes (20), Muslims (18), and Adivasi (one).\n\nAmong the Congress 61 candidates, 22, or nearly 36%, were from upper castes, including 8 Brahmin and Bhumihar candidates each, 5 Rajputs, and 1 Kayastha.\n\nClick here to read more",
