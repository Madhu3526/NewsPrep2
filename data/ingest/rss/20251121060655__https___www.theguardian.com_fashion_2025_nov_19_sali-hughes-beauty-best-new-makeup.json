  "text": "This has been an excellent year for new makeup, starting with Givenchy’s comeback. Having infuriated the beauty community by (badly) reformulating its classic loose powder, it won back detractors with the exceptionally good Prisme Libre Pressed Powder, which blurs, smoothes and near-perfects a face of makeup, and now lives full time in my handbag. This was followed by a Bronzer Powder version, also £45, which succeeded in moving me away from creams to achieve a filtered, sun-kissed finish. Full marks with distinction for both.\n\nThe Guardian’s journalism is independent. We will earn a commission if you buy something through an affiliate link.

These are to other lipliners what tinted lip balms are to lipsticks – sheer, moist and mistake-proof. They offer a perfect solution to minimal makeup wearers in search of some extra polish. Bespoke, Merit’s beloved rosy brown, looks pretty and cool on everyone.\n\nRegulars will know it takes a lot for an eye palette to excite me. I generally favour single cream shadows from Bobbi Brown, Armani, Makeup by Mario and Vieve. But Viseart’s VisePRO Étendu powder eyeshadow palettes (£40) have my heart. Viseart is a professional brand, which, I think, conveys the idea that one needs to be technically skilled to get the best from the products, but the opposite is true. Shades are curated so well as to have done away with the need for thinking time. But it’s the exceptional textures that knock off my socks. You will not find smoother, silkier, more easily blendable shadows anywhere.\n\nskip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Inside Saturday Free weekly newsletter The only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

Never have my not-pretty hands received more compliments than when dressed in Thornbird (£15.50), a sophisticated, neutral khaki green that adds interest and edge while sitting appropriately against any outfit.",
