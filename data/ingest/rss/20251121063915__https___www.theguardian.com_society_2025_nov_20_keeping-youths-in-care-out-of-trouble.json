However, international research studies have shown that reducing the chances of young people being involved in crime to begin with are more effective.\n\nThese include: stable family foster care placements; doing well at school; extending foster care placements beyond 18 years of age; having positive birth family, extended family, partner and social relationships; being settled in accommodation on leaving care; and being supported by leaving-care teams providing personal, careers, housing and financial support.\n\nFor too many young people these opportunities are lacking or inconsistent, even in the face of substantial evidence detailing their unnecessary involvement in the criminal justice system, very poor outcomes and the associated costs to young people and society – see In Care, Out of Trouble, the report of Lord Laming’s review, published by the Prison Reform Trust in 2016.\n\nProf Mike Stein\n\nUniversity of York",
