  "text": "Whether you're worried about the open network at your local coffee shop or want to get around geo-restrictions when you're traveling, NordVPN can help. A virtual private network (VPN) is like a protective tunnel, keeping your data safe from prying eyes. VPNs aren’t perfect protection (you need to trust your VPN provider), but they’re always going to be better than nothing when you’re using a public hotspot. They also make it easy to continue to watch your favorite shows even when you’re on vacation. If you want to learn more about how to protect yourself online, see our guide to The Best VPNs.\n\nDon’t Miss Out on This NordVPN Black Friday Deal\n\nNordVPN Black Friday deals are already rolling in! Right now, the best NordVPN Black Friday deal we’ve seen is 75% off, plus 3 months extra for free with the biggest cybersecurity sale of the year. With NordVPN, you can secure up to 10 devices with a single account, plus you’ll be able to avoid phishing, scams, and malware like never before.\n\nGet 77% Off Plans With Exclusive NordVPN Discount Code\n\nNordVPN is pretty much always having a sale, but some of the deals are better than others and this is one of the best we’ve seen. Right now, NordVPN is offering 77% off its regular price, plus an Amazon gift card valued up to $50 when you sign up for a 2-year Prime plan. It's valid for the first 15 months of the subscription, with threat protection, high-speed VPN, and more. Follow the link above and use our exclusive coupon code at checkout to get the deal.\n\nSave More With a NordVPN Subscription Plan\n\nThe two-year Plus plan is the most popular, and our recommendation. For a limited time, their more comprehensive Prime 2-year subscriptions qualify for up to 77% off, and you’ll receive 3 free months with select 2-year plans, starting with the Plus option.\n\nNordVPN offers different plans for different needs, including one-year and one-month plans. Plans’ pricing varies greatly, with short-term, one-month plans starting at $13. The plans get cheaper the longer you commit to a plan, to reward loyal VPN customers. One-year plans start at $5 and go to $10, depending on which package you choose. Two-year plans are even cheaper, starting at $3 and going up to $7 for the top-tier plans with all of the bells and whistles. It makes a lot more sense to invest in a longer protection plan to keep your information and devices safe, for less.\n\nScore a NordVPN Discount Code for 15% Off\n\nThe coupons aren’t the only deals to be had. You can wait for a sale (see above) or if you qualify, there are discounts for students, graduates, teachers, healthcare, military, and first responders. Once verified with Student Beans, you can unlock a NordVPN promo code for 15% off plans.\n\nNordVPN Friend Referral Discount\n\nIf you like NordVPN, you can save yourself even more with the refer-a-friend promotion. You’ll receive 3 months free for every friend who buys NordVPN through your referral link. The more friends you refer, the more rewards you’ll earn. Your friends will get the same deal you did, 3 extra months if they choose the 1- or 2-year plans or 1 free month if they opt for the monthly plan.\n\nCan You Get a Free Trial With NordVPN?\n\nCurious about NordVPN services but don’t want to make the jump? You’re in luck. NordVPN offers a 30-day free trial. To try it out, you’ll need to pick the plan that’s right for you, and download the NordVPN app on your device. NordVPN also has a 3-day free trial on Android. And you can try NordVPN risk free for a month: you’ll need to pay for a subscription up front, but if NordVPN isn’t the right fit, you can request a refund within 30 days of your date of purchase.\n\nGet the latest NordVPN Plans in 2025\n\nNordVPN has four tiers of plans fit for every type of need. Each gets you a secure VPN, but with each level you’ll get even more perks, like an ad tracker and blocker and 1 TB of Cloud storage. Right now, you can get up to 77% off each plan, including three months free. Check out which plan (and price) is the best fit for you here.",
