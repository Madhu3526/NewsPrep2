The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says it is aware of small numbers of cases of this strain of mpox - formerly known as monkeypox - in Spain, Italy, Portugal and the Netherlands, as well as the US. Mpox is usually a mild infection but it can be severe and getting vaccinated is the best protection, the UKHSA says. Charities also urged vaccination before travelling to Winter Pride events in Europe this autumn.\n\n\"The ways in which we are seeing mpox continue to spread globally is a reminder to come forward for the vaccine, if you are eligible,\" said Dr Katy Sinka, head of sexually transmitted infections at UKHSA. A new UKHSA report on mpox says there is now a high risk of clade I being imported into the UK through travel. But it says onwards spread \"is likely to be controlled to some degree\" by the existing vaccination programme for gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (GBMSM). The vaccine is recommended if you're at higher risk of getting mpox. This is mainly men who have sex with men, and those who: have multiple sexual partners\n\nhave group sex\n\nvisit sex-on-premises venues The mpox vaccine is also recommended for people who work at sex-on-premises venues, such as cleaning staff and anyone who has had or will have close contact with someone who has mpox, the NHS website says. Although the vaccine hasn't been tested against clade Ib mpox, it is known to be effective in protecting against another strain called clade II. As a result, health officials says vaccine protection is expected. Vaccination is now available from sexual health services. NHS advice is to call a sexual health clinic about the mpox vaccine before going along.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of Mpox?",
