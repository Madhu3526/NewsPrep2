  "text": "With every breath, local people absorb lead particles into their bloodstreams. The metal seeps into their brains, wreaking havoc on nervous systems. Toddlers ingest it by crawling across floors and then putting their hands in their mouths, in some cases leading to irreversible brain damage.\n\nThis public health catastrophe is the result of local factories that recycle car batteries, extracting the lead within to make new products. They do this in Nigeria thanks to a well-established, if unsavory, reality of the global economy: As tighter standards have limited lead pollution in wealthier nations, manufacturers have shifted their sights abroad. They rely increasingly on communities so desperate for jobs that their leaders have tacitly accepted lead poisoning as the cost of livelihood.\n\nYou can click here to read the details of our investigation, conducted in partnership with The Examination, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates global health. We commissioned blood tests for 70 Ogijo residents, which found harmful levels of lead in 7 out of 10 people. And we traced the lead recycled in Nigeria to a major battery manufacturer in the U.S. whose products are found under the hoods of millions of cars.",
  "summary": "We went to Nigeria, where recycling plants are extracting lead for use in American and European car batteries — at a terrible human cost.",
