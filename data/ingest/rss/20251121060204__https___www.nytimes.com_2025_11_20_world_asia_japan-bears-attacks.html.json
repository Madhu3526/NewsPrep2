  "text": "Japan’s demographic changes have also exacerbated the problem. Farming communities used to serve as buffers, separating the mountains from more densely inhabited areas. But as Japan’s population shrinks and ages, and as young people move to cities, some rural areas have hollowed out. Bears are moving in, inching closer to human settlements.\n\nIn Japan, where mountains and forests make up about 70 percent of the land, bears are considered sacred beings. In Hokkaido, Japan’s northernmost island, which has also seen a spike in attacks, the brown bear is revered as a deity living in the human realm.\n\nBut concerns about tradition and conservation have largely been set aside as public anxiety has swelled. The Japanese government sent troops this month to hard-hit areas like Akita to help set traps. Riot police have joined forces with the thinning ranks of hunters to track and kill bears. Drones — including some that emit the sound of barking dogs — have been deployed over parks. A prominent Japanese university recently released a “Bear Encounter AI Prediction Map” to forecast bear activity.",
  "summary": "Residents in the northern region of Akita are living in fear after dozens of assaults on humans. Riot police and the army have been sent to help.",
