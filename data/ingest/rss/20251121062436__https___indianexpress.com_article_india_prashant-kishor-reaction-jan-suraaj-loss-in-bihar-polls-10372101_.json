  "title": "‘Came to change system, couldn’t even change government’: Prashant Kishor on Jan Suraaj’s poor show in Bihar polls",
  "text": "Jan Suraaj Party founder Prashant Kishor, in his first post-Bihar election press conference on Tuesday, said the party tried honestly to change the system but it failed to even change the government. “We came to Bihar three years ago to change the system and made an honest effort, but we did not succeed. We couldn’t even change the government, but we have changed politics to some extent,” he said. The Jan Suraaj Party failed to get even a single seat in the Bihar Assembly Election. The party even lost its deposits in 236 of 238 seats.\n\n“The party that secured just 3.5% votes and still draws so much media attention shows we have done something meaningful… There must have been shortcomings that people couldn’t trust us. It is my responsibility, and I own all the blame for the election results. We have lost collectively,” Prashant Kishor further said.",
