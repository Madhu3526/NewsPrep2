  "text": "US media giant Paramount has won the rights to show Champions League matches in the UK for four years from 2027.\n\nBBC Sport has been told the company will pay well in excess of the near-£1bn deal currently in place with TNT Sports.\n\nAmazon Prime will continue to show a game every Tuesday in the UK from 2027 to 2031.\n\nParamount's deal comes after the joint UC3 initiative between European football's governing body Uefa, European Football Clubs (formerly the European Club Association) and commercial rights partner Relevent.\n\nParamount worked with Uefa on the elaborate films screened around the Champions League draw for the past two seasons.\n\nSources have suggested the deal could be seen as good news for the Premier League given it adds another big broadcasting name to the football rights market and should not lead to an overall reduction in the TV pot.\n\nThere has recently been speculation of a bid by Paramount for Warner Bros Discovery, which includes TNT in its portfolio.\n\nMeanwhile, Sky has announced it has secured the exclusive rights to show every Europa League and Conference League match in the UK over four years from the 2027-28 season - 342 games each season.",
