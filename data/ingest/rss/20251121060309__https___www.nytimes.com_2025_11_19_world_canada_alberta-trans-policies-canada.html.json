  "title": "Alberta Invokes Last-Resort Constitutional Clause to Shield Trans Laws From Challenges",
  "text": "The conservative government of the western Canadian province of Alberta has invoked a last-resort clause in the country’s Constitution to insulate three sweeping trans bills from legal challenges.\n\nThe three bills limit access to gender-affirming care for minors, prohibit trans youth from competing in women’s and girls’ sports and introduce a requirement for parents to approve informal pronoun changes at school for children 16 and under.\n\nThe measures are considered by some advocates for transgender people as the strictest in Canada and the province’s constitutional maneuver essentially prevents individuals or organizations from pursuing legal challenges.\n\nThe bills passed the provincial legislature at the end of last year, and one of them is already suspended as it faces a court challenge that could be dismissed in light of the province’s constitutional maneuver.",
  "summary": "The western province’s conservative government has invoked a rarely used clause in Canada’s Constitution to shield its bills limiting transgender rights from legal challenges.",
