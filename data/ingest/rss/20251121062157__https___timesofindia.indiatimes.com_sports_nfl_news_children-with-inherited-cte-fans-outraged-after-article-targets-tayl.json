The article, which attempted to mock themes from Swift’s album The Life of a Showgirl, crossed a line for many readers when it referenced chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) while discussing hypothetical children Swift might have with her fiancé.What was intended as satire quickly became a flashpoint for criticism, especially as the comments involved a serious neurological condition and misrepresented its causes. As online outrage escalates, Vulture has quietly deleted the article link on X, but has yet to publicly address the controversy.The most inflammatory line from the article read, “It’s not just that the album also features the line ‘Did you girlboss too close to the sun?’ and a startling, detailed account of how she plans to start a neighborhood full of children with inherited CTE with the help of her fiancé’s gigantic football d*ck.”The mention of “inherited CTE” immediately drew fire, as critics argued it trivialized a life-altering condition linked to repeated head impacts, most commonly seen in contact sports. Fans also argued the remark targeted Swift’s hypothetical children in a cruel, sexist way, turning a health condition into a punchline.One reaction that went viral said, “we’ve reached a point where ‘cultural criticism’ means inventing hypothetical children with neurological diseases just to attack taylor”. Another added, “What an utterly bizarre and cruel thing to say, making sweeping ableist statements and attacking Taylor Swift’s unborn children”.The backlash extended beyond Swift’s fanbase. A public health professional warned that presenting CTE as genetic spreads dangerous misinformation, stating, “the suggestion that CTE can be passed from parent to child is dangerous misinformation… & should never have passed review.”Vulture’s decision to delete the link without explanation has only intensified frustration, leaving readers demanding accountability for a piece many believe crossed the line between satire and harm.Also Read: “She doesn’t want to see him”: Taylor Swift refuses Joe Alwyn’s plea for closure as she happily moved on with Travis Kelce",
