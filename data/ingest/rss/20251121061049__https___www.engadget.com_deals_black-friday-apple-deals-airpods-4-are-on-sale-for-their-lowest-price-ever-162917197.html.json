  "text": "Black Friday Apple deals are already trickling in, and one of the best we're tracking is on the AirPods 4. They're down to $80 right now, which is a new record low. While these buds don't provide active noise cancellation, they're still a great option for those who want all of the conveniences of a pair of Apple earbuds in an affordable package.\n\nThe Apple AirPods 4 are the best budget AirPods you can get in 2025, with Apple's H2 audio chip to support some of the more advanced audio features from more expensive models.\n\nThey offer Voice Isolation, Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking and more. If you get the model without active noise cancellation, you won't have features like Transparency Mode and Conversation Awareness, or Apple's hearing health tools. But, the entry-level model still offers great sound quality for the price.\n\nAdvertisement Advertisement\n\nThis model also features the redesigned shape, which makes for a more comfortable and secure fit so you don't have to worry about them falling out of your ears. A force sensor on the stem allows for basic touch controls, including play and pause, play next track, previous track and answer a call. You can also summon Siri by pressing and holding the stem.\n\nYou can expect to get up to 5 hours of battery life on a charge with the non-ANC model, and up to 30 hours using the USB-C charging case.\n\nElsewhere when it comes to Black Friday AirPods deals, you can pick up the AirPods 4 with ANC for only $110, and the new AirPods Pro 3 for $220.",
