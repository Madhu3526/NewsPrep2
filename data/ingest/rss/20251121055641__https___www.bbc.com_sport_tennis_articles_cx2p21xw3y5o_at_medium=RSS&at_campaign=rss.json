  "text": "Britain's Katie Boulter says she feels she has to \"choose between my body and my ranking\" as the scramble continues for a place in January's Australian Open main draw.\n\nWhile the regular WTA Tour season is over, there are still ranking points to be won in Chile, Argentina, Ecuador and France.\n\nThe women’s entry list for the first Grand Slam of the 2026 season will be based on the world rankings of 8 December, which could cause a dilemma for players close to the cut.\n\nAlthough 104 players will receive direct entry into the Melbourne draw, that includes those with protected rankings, meaning Boulter - who sustained a hip injury in October - could miss out despite currently occupying 100th spot.\n\n\"If there are tournaments there, it gives you an opportunity because you want to make the main draw of Australia,\" Boulter, 29, told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I'm in this predicament myself right now, and it's almost like I have to choose between my body or my ranking.\n\n\"I think I know my own right choice, but it's difficult because it means that everyone else is going to be playing and passing me.\"",
