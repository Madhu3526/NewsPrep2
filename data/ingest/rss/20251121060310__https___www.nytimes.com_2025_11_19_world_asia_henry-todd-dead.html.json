  "text": "Henry Todd, a Scotsman who helped run a drug ring that made and sold millions of LSD tablets in the 1970s, and who later turned to a different type of high, organizing mountain-climbing expeditions to the Himalayas, died on Nov. 3 in Kathmandu, Nepal. He was 80.\n\nHis family announced his death, in a hospital, but did not provide a cause.\n\nLSD helped define the 1960s counterculture, spurred on by Timothy Leary, who preached the mantra “turn on, tune in, drop out.” The profits that were possible from manufacturing and distributing the psychedelic drug brought Mr. Todd into the business in 1970.\n\nBacked by a financier in London, he worked with a chemist, Richard Kemp, to produce a very pure form of LSD. A brash personality, Mr. Todd became something akin to the endeavor’s marketing manager.\n\nAfter a falling out with Mr. Kemp in 1973, Mr. Todd started a new LSD business in his house in Hampton Wick, near London. The lab was in the attic, and the tablets were made a floor below. Mr. Kemp established his own factory in Wales.",
