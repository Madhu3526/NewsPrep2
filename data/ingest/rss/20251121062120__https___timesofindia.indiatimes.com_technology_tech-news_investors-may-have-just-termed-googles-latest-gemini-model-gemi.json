  "text": "Google (File Image)\n\nGemini Comes To Chrome: How Google Is Improving Browser With AI - Explained\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet Inc shares surged to their highest level in history on Wednesday, fueled by a wave of overwhelmingly positive reviews for the newly released version of its Gemini artificial intelligence model. The Google parent's stock climbed as much as 6.9%, marking its largest gain in two months and besting the performance of the broader market, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The robust rally was sparked by investor confidence in the company's leading position within the rapidly evolving tech landscape.The momentum was palpable in trading pits. More than 376,000 call options on Alphabet had changed hands by 11:00 a.m. in New York, well above the recent full-day average. For context, the technology-focused Nasdaq 100 Index was up 0.8%, while the S&P 500 Index gained about 0.5%.The new Gemini model, unveiled on Tuesday, received \"glowing reviews about its capabilities,\" Bloomberg reported, contrasting its reception with the \"mixed reactions\" that met OpenAI’s GPT-5 model earlier in the year.The enthusiasm prompted one analyst to pose a pointed question: “Is Gemini 3 What GPT-5 was supposed to be?” Robert W.Baird & Co. analyst Colin Sebastian wrote in a note to clients, citing the \"rave reviews\" for the latest iteration. Sebastian highlighted a key competitive edge for Google: \"In addition to benefits to Search engagement and monetization, Google also combines real-time web indexing with advanced model training, which we view as a key competitive advantage,” he added.This AI-driven jump is the latest piece of good news for the Mountain View, California-based giant. Earlier this week, Loop Capital upgraded Alphabet's stock to \"buy,\" suggesting that previous concerns had been “obliterated under waves of AI enthusiasm.”Furthermore, the stock received a rare vote of confidence last week when Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. disclosed it had built a stake in Alphabet during the third quarter. Bloomberg noted this move represents a show of faith from the legendary investor, who generally avoids deep exposure to tech stocks outside of Apple Inc.Wednesday's rally further solidified what has been a banner 2025 for Alphabet. Its 57% jump year-to-date makes it the best-performing member of the \"Magnificent 7\" cohort and puts its returns at more than three times that of the Nasdaq 100 Index.",
  "summary": "Alphabet shares reached an all-time high, driven by overwhelmingly positive reviews for its new Gemini AI model. The surge reflects investor confidence in Google's leading position in AI, with analysts highlighting its competitive advantages. This AI-driven success caps a strong year for the tech giant.",
