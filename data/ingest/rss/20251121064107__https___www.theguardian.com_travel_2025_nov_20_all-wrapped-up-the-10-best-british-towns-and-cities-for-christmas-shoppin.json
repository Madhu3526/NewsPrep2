Trespass is good for van lifers and campers, with folding furniture, lighting and clever cooking stoves, alongside ski, surf and hiking gear; while Mallon & Green has rods, lines, tools and accessories for the angler in your life. Pause for coffee at Summat, the in-house café at Inov8 – a shop that sells everything from bags and beanies to running and hiking footwear and nifty accessories – and reward yourself with a Bakewell pudding (never a “tart”) from The Old Original Bakewell Pudding Shop.

Browse the historic workshops on Legge Lane, pop into Deakin & Francis, where jewellery has been designed and created in the same building since 1786, and take a guided tour of the Museum of the Jewellery Quarter. Ponder your purchases over lunch at 1000 Trades, a historic pub that was originally a jewellery workshop.

Photograph: Cambridge Contemporary Art\n\nCambridge’s historic streets are dotted with galleries and elegant museum shops, which makes it a great place to pick up a one-off artwork or unusual gift. Byard Art, opposite King’s College, is a good place to start, with works by more than 50 contemporary artists, while Cambridge Contemporary Art, just along the road, specialises in handmade prints, ceramics and crafts. Get inspiration from browsing some of the half a million artworks at the Fitzwilliam Museum, before picking up more art-themed gifts at the excellent museum shop; or dip into the shop at Kettle’s Yard for art-themed books, homeware, fashion and stationery. Stay at the Varsity on the banks of the River Cam, with room-only doubles from £155.\n\nBooks, Wigtown, Dumfries and Galloway\n\nView image in fullscreen The Bookshop in Wigtown. Photograph: Jeff Gilbert/Alamy\n\nHome to 17 bookshops and book-related businesses, Wigtown is the perfect place to find literary treats, vintage titles and specialist books that make unusual Christmas gifts. Allow plenty of time to browse in the Bookshop, where more than a mile of shelving holds about 100,000 new and secondhand books, dip into the Old Bank Bookshop for vintage books on everything from art and architecture to travel and memoirs, and pick up presents for younger family members at Foggie Toddle Books.

Photograph: York Cocoa Works\n\nChristmas wouldn’t be Christmas without an unseemly amount of chocolate, and few places have a more cocoa-rich history than York, home to Rowntree’s, Nestlé and Terry’s. Kick off a chocoday with a visit to York’s Chocolate Story, where the interactive displays cover everything from how chocolate is produced to the history of the most familiar brands, with plenty of tastings along the way. Then pop into York Cocoa Works where the Christmas collection includes stocking fillers, hampers, vegan chocolate and mince pie-flavour caramels. Finish up at Monk Bar Chocolatiers – the oldest artisan chocolatier in town. Stay at the Fat Badger, a cosy inn with room-only doubles from £119.\n\nCeramics, Stoke-on-Trent\n\nView image in fullscreen Middleport Pottery in Stoke-on-Trent. Photograph: Tony Wright/Earthscapes/Alamy\n\nThere’s no such thing as too many mugs – or vases, dinner plates or jugs – particularly when they’re handmade in one of Stoke’s historic potteries. Middleport Pottery is a great place to start; it’s the UK’s last working Victorian potbank in continuous production, with guided and self-led heritage tours, a well-stocked gift shop and the Burleigh Factory Shop, where the shelves brim with affordable seconds. For quirky, contemporary designs, head to Emma Bridgewater; while for something more classic, World of Wedgwood has a large outlet centre and a store selling Waterford crystal, alongside chinaware. Stay at the Hilton Garden Inn, with room-only doubles from £132.\n\nCraft beers, Sheffield\n\nView image in fullscreen The Brewery of Saint Mars of the Desert in Sheffield. Photograph: The Brewery of Saint Mars of the Desert\n\nThere are 58 breweries in and around Sheffield, making it the perfect place to pick up unusual ales and beers for the festive period, or gifts for any enthusiasts in the family. Choose from more than 200 beers – from Belgian to barrel-aged – at Hop Hideout, while the Bear offers everything from lagers and sours to dark beers and IPAs. The wonderfully named Saint Mars of the Desert is also worth tracking down; the taproom is open from 2pm to 8pm on Fridays and Saturdays, with cans and bottles of fruity, hazy bitters to take home. If coming by train, start with a pint or two at Triple Point Brewery, a five-minute walk from Sheffield station, where all the beer is brewed on site, and stay at the Crow Inn, known for its range of cask ales, with room-only doubles from £50.\n\nToys, Llandeilo, Carmarthenshire\n\nView image in fullscreen Market Street, Llandeilo. Photograph: Simon Whaley Landscapes/Alamy\n\nA small market town on the edge of Bannau Brycheiniog (Brecon Beacons), Llandeilo punches above its weight in terms of shops. Eve’s Toy Shop is a gift when it comes to buying Christmas presents for younger family members, with hand-carved wooden games and puzzles, mini gardening tools and “kidnoculars” for junior explorers, along with all the unicorns you can carry. Once the kids are ticked off, pop into Davies & Co for handmade Welsh blankets; Peppercorn for culinary-themed gifts; and Dot Clothing for elegant womenswear from niche designers. Stay at the Cawdor, a revamped coaching inn on the high street, with B&B doubles from £115.",
