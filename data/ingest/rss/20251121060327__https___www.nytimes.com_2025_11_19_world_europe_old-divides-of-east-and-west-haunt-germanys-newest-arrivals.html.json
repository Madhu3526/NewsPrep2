  "text": "Sabri Kadib Alban needed seven tries to cross from Turkey to Greece after he fled Syria, and then five more to cross from Greece to Italy. He lost 30 pounds. After six months he reached Germany, where he had heard the schools would be best for his children. He landed in a small town in the western hills, called Daun.\n\nWhen Bashar Amin arrived from Syria, he also first headed west. But then he moved to Leipzig, a large city near the eastern border with Poland. There, he settled into a life more difficult than he expected when he left behind his war-torn home.\n\nOver the course of a decade, Mr. Kadib Alban and Mr. Amin discovered a stubborn fact about their new home. Thirty-five years after reunification, economic success in Germany is still heavily dictated by geography.\n\nIt is an inequality that has plagued native Germans since the end of the Cold War. New research shows it has haunted immigrants, too.",
  "summary": "Refugees who poured into the country a decade ago fared better when they landed in the more prosperous West, an enduring legacy of reunification.",
