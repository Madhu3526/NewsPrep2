  "text": "Prof Clara Mancini, who led on the product's design and research, said: \"Dogs, particularly those trained to support people, are asked to interface with an environment that is not constructed for them.\n\n\"We wanted to rethink this in a way in that would help dogs, so we studied how they interact with the world around them.\n\n\"They see blue well, so that's the colour of the button, and we put white casing around it to create contrast.\n\n\"It also needed to be wireless so it could be positioned where it would be most accessible for the dog to reach.\"\n\nProf Mancini has trained her own dog, a husky named Kara, to use the Dogosophy Button.\n\nShe said: \"The challenge with huskies is that they're not very biddable, whereas something like a Labrador is easier to train.\n\n\"If you catch a husky's interest, they will engage - otherwise, they won't.\"",
