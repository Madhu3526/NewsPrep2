  "text": "This recipe, another in the first recipes for singles series, is a good starting point, but the tomato sauce needs a lot of augmentation to taste like more than canned tomato: Italian seasoning, red wine, tomato paste, onion, crushed garlic, a little sugar, salt, maybe some mushrooms, some ground beef or pork for the carnivores out there. Adding more ingredients will of course increase the prep time, but the prep time to flavor balance definitely comes down on the flavor side. And there is no reason to use whole tomatoes, which usually have some skin on them, unless you like to squeeze them in your hands, which admittedly I do. Crushed or chopped canned tomato will work just as well.\n\nIs this helpful? 198",
