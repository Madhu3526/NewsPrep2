  "text": "Speaking anonymously in a statement provided by Thompsons Solicitors, one mother said she dashed to the school after receiving a call about the carbon monoxide (CO) leak.\n\nShe said the scene was like something from a zombie film - youngsters vomiting, fainting and some lying on the floor sleeping.\n\nFor weeks her children had complained of feeling extremely unwell when collected from Balmuildy Primary School, only to quickly recover once they were home.\n\n\"They sat in a building inhaling fatal levels of carbon monoxide which we have been told but for 'sheer luck' there was no fatalities due to the high level of CO detected,\" she said.\n\n\"Now as parents we are left with a feeling of guilt for not realising what was happening sooner and putting our children continuously in a place of danger.\n\n\"More concerningly now is not knowing the long-term side effects of this prolonged exposure.\"\n\nAnother mother took her son to hospital after he complained of sickness, headaches and feeling dizzy.\n\nShe said: \"He had blood taken and got told his symptoms were a result of carbon monoxide poisoning, but by this point it was starting to leave his system.\"\n\n\"This could have been serious for my son, as well as for the other children and the staff at the school.\n\n\"My son still suffers from headaches as a result of his exposure and the fact that it wasn't properly checked shows the incompetence of the council.\"",
