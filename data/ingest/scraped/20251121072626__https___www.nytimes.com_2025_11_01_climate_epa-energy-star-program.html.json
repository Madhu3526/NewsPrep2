  "text": "Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has quietly retreated from plans to eliminate Energy Star, a popular program whose iconic blue labels help consumers to choose energy efficient dishwashers, refrigerators and other home appliances.\n\nIn a rare shift, Mr. Zeldin is reconsidering his announcement from May that he would end the program, which triggered intense pushback from business leaders and congressional Republicans, according to four people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nShortly after Mr. Zeldin said he would eliminate Energy Star, the E.P.A. renewed four contracts with ICF, a consulting firm that helps administer the program, according to federal records. One contract was renewed through September of 2030. The company did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBrigit Hirsch, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in email that “no final decision has been made at this time” on whether to keep Energy Star.",
