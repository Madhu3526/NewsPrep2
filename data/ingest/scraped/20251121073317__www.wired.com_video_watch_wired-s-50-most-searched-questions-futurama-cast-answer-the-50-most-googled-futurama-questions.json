Fry,\n\npizza delivery boy\n\nand Professor Hubert Farnsworth, 147-year-old [groaning]\n\nand the voice of Zapp Brannigan.\n\nNow everybody go take a nap\n\nand improve the quality of life around here, won't you, eh?\n\nAnd we're gonna try and answer the most Googled questions\n\nabout our show Futurama.\n\nI hope there's something to eat in this box.\n\n[all laughing]\n\n[upbeat music]\n\nAre Futurama and the Simpsons made by the same people?\n\nYes. Yes, Matt Groening\n\nand a bunch of Harvard alumni.\n\nExactly, I don't know why the geniuses\n\nare always kind of shy and sweet,\n\nbut that's what it seems like anyway.\n\nWell, I wish people this smart made more movies.\n\nExactly. I wish all of society\n\nwas like that.\n\nHow about that?\n\nHere's one.\n\nAre Fry and Leela married.\n\nI think they did get married, yes?\n\nAbsolutely they did.\n\nFinally, yes, after going through so much romance\n\nand so many ups and downs,\n\nand you don't need two eyes just to be married.\n\nRight, how is Fry related to the Professor?\n\nWell, he's the great, great, great, great, great, great,\n\n[Phil] great, forever great. Uncle.\n\nNephew, great nephew.\n\nFry is older than the professor though.\n\nWhich year is Futurama currently in?\n\nIsn't it a thousand years from this year?\n\nYes, which is.\n\nOh, is that right? So it would be 3000.\n\n3025?\n\nWell, we started. Oh, that's right.\n\nThe show in 1999,\n\nAnd the first episode was in 3099.\n\nWait, '99, but I got married in 97.\n\nNo, I'm sorry, it was 2999.\n\nOkay. Right before,\n\nand new year was 3000.\n\nOkay. We're not math majors.\n\nSomething like that.\n\nWe didn't go to Harvard.\n\nNo. [Phil laughing]\n\nOkay.\n\nWhy don't you read it?\n\nWhat's Amy Wong's Home Planet?\n\nOh, thank God I know one.\n\nMars, we own half of it.\n\nHer family owns half of Mars.\n\nThey own a herd of buggalo.\n\nIt must be nice. Yeah, and it's,\n\nand it's interesting in Futurama,\n\nMars is where people with good money live,\n\nnot just green people.\n\n[Lauren laughing]\n\nYes, and there's also, it's the home of Mars University.\n\nYes, the best school\n\nthat's like the Harvard of the universe, right?\n\n[Phil laughing]\n\nHow did Hermes lose his body?\n\nDoing limbo under swords.\n\nIs that right? Mm hmm.\n\nOh, my God, I blocked that out.\n\nYeah. Wow.\n\nHe got, cut him, and then got his head cut off.\n\nSeriously? Oh my God.\n\nBut he got it back though, right?\n\nYeah.\n\nOkay. In the next episode\n\nor at the end of that episode?\n\nIn the end of that episode. Okay, good.\n\nYeah, we can't let anything happen to him.\n\nNo. What instrument\n\ndoes Fry try to learn?\n\nI think, well it was an instrument,\n\na really cool looking instrument called the Holophonor,\n\nand what it does is it plays notes that become visuals.\n\nOh, I love that. It's very beautiful,\n\nvery psychedelic, and he wants to demonstrate his love\n\nthrough music and notes and visuals for Leela\n\nwho missed the whole thing.\n\nAnd yes, it was all for nothing.\n\nLike most love I've ever known.\n\nNo, come on now. [Phil laughing]\n\nWhat's the title of the first episode?\n\nUh oh, I need help.\n\nAh, the title of the first episode was Space Pilot 3000.\n\nIs that right?\n\nOkay, very good, Phil.\n\nThe series has landed.\n\nAnd it's probably more about Fry\n\nwanting to be a pilot in space\n\nas opposed to just referring to the first episode of a show.\n\nRight, right.\n\nAnd that was a long time ago.\n\nAnd we watched that pilot at the Observatory.\n\nThat's right, it was so beautiful.\n\nThey screened it on the ceiling,\n\nand we all just like laid back and watched.\n\nIt was just, it was such a magical night.\n\nAh, that's for you Phil.\n\nThis question was, does Hermes eat\n\nmore than just Manwiches?\n\nYeah. Be careful.\n\nOf course. Like what?\n\nHe eats lots of other things.\n\nI mean, 'cause his wife cooks well.\n\nThat's right.\n\nDoes he eat. La Barbara?\n\nYeah. Does he eat jerk chicken?\n\nYeah.\n\nHow about jerk pork? Yeah.\n\nDo you like that in real life?\n\nYeah. Well, I don't have\n\nhis hair or his stuff. [Lauren laughing]\n\nI don't, I don't eat like my cartoon character.\n\nNo?\n\nWhere is Fry from?\n\nWell, he appears to be from New York City.\n\nRight.\n\nAt least that's where he lived\n\nwhen he was delivering pizzas,\n\nbut I think his family might be from.\n\nThat's even where he went to school in eight.\n\nYeah. His personality\n\nseems more like Midwest to me. Old New York.\n\nLike down to earth, you know, just so down to earth.\n\nHe's all over the place, and he's kind of needy,\n\nbut his heart's in the right place.\n\nHow old is Leela?\n\nNever tell a thing like that.\n\nI don't know, she looked like, when he first met her,\n\nshe looked like she was about 30 maybe.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nStill a baby.\n\nHow old is the Professor? Ah that one,\n\nwe might actually know.\n\nNow we talked about this.\n\nHe's 147, but he's older now\n\nbecause that's how old he was when we started.\n\nRight, right, he was 147 in 2999.\n\nOkay, how did Futurama start?\n\nIt started in the mind of Matt Groening.\n\nYeah.\n\nI remember in 1964 or five,\n\nI went to the New York World's Fair,\n\nand I rode on a ride called the Futurama.\n\nOh really? And that's where the name\n\nof the show came from.\n\nOh. Really?\n\nOh wow. Yeah, it was\n\nGeneral Motors had a ride called Futurama.\n\nDid you talk to Matt about that?\n\nOh sure. Oh!\n\nWow. And I remember\n\nriding on it when I was about 11,\n\nand it showed you what the future was gonna look like.\n\nBoy, did they lie?\n\nBoy, were they wrong.\n\nDamn, I wish I'd Googled that.\n\nHow rich is Fry?\n\nWell, he's been super rich.\n\nHe was, when? Because he had\n\nsome sardines or anchovies rather.\n\nOh. That were worth\n\ntons of money in the future.\n\nI forgot that. Right.\n\nWho ordered the pizza?\n\nAh, I know.\n\nWho?\n\nYou mean at the place where he got frozen?\n\nWhere, yeah, in the cryogenics lab.\n\nOh.\n\nPizza delivery for Icy Wiener.\n\nOh yeah! Oh my gosh, I can't.\n\nIcy Wiener.\n\nIt was a prank.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, here's the first person\n\nto memorize his cartoon script.\n\n[Lauren laughing]\n\nWho is Agnew?\n\nWell, if anybody knows their history,\n\nhe was Nixon's vice president.\n\nOh. But he's the headless body\n\nof Agnew in the show.\n\nSo I don't know how he growls.\n\nHe growls like Frankenstein. [Billy growling]\n\n[Phil laughing]\n\nI do Richard Nixon in the show,\n\nand I don't sound anything like him.\n\nI'm like, [Billy growling]\n\nbut I saw the debate between Nixon and Kennedy in 1962.\n\nAnd Kennedy looked like a game show host.\n\nAnd Nixon looked like a sweat hog.\n\nHe was sweating and his hair was matted,\n\nand they did extreme closeups.\n\nAnd you could see the hair growing out of his pores.\n\nHe was like, I wanna be President of the United States\n\nbecause, [Billy growling]\n\nand I said to my mom,\n\nmom, he looks like he's gonna turn into a werewolf.\n\n[Phil laughing]\n\nAnd so that's why I howl like a werewolf doing Nixon.\n\n[Billy growling]\n\nI am Richard M. Nixon, President of Earth.\n\nAnd [Billy growling and howling]\n\nThat bastard drafted me in 1980 by the way, in 1980, 1970.\n\nAnd to this very day in the Nixon Library\n\nruns a continuous loop of all the Nixon stuff\n\nI did on Futurama, in his library.\n\nSo I won. Ah!\n\nWhat Olympic sport did Hermes compete in?\n\nHe did the Olympics, he did limbo.\n\nOf course he did.\n\nHow did he do?\n\nHmm, he did really good. Yeah?\n\nWell, he was almost there up against the bigger guy.\n\nBut hopefully in the future\n\nthat will be added to the Olympics.\n\nChuck that for us.\n\nChuck it. Yay!\n\nOh hey.\n\nOh shoot, I'm gonna need help.\n\nWhat is Amy's obscene tattoo?\n\nDo you guys know?\n\nI only have one?\n\nI didn't know she had a tattoo.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nDo I have two?\n\nGimme a hint.\n\nSlippery when wet. No.\n\nNo.\n\n[Interviewer] Part of the running gag\n\nis that we never actually see what it is.\n\nOh!\n\nSo that's just for me to know and you to find out.\n\nAnd she knows more about the show than we do.\n\nHow do you feel now?\n\nAh, good.\n\nSo I don't have to answer that, do I?\n\nHow long can humans live?\n\nWell-- In Futurama?\n\nI mean. A long time.\n\nLong time. On Mars?\n\nWell, how old is the Professor\n\nwhen Fry gets to the future? 147 years old.\n\nSo in a thousand years, we'll all live hundreds of years.\n\nAs long as you eat dog food.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nTurns out dog food is a health food in the future.\n\nNo, not, I don't know.\n\nI'm just making stuff up.\n\nIs Leela an alien or a mutant?\n\nShe's a mutant. Right, she calls herself\n\nan alien, but she's actually a mutant.\n\nYes, and. Which is why\n\nher family lives underground.\n\nAnd that's why she's a cyclops.\n\nHer family is, they're the nicest people.\n\nThey just look really weird.\n\nBut, you know, who's to judge?\n\nI already, I already told you why Nixon howls.\n\nWhy does Nixon howl? I howl\n\nbecause I have big jowls. [Billy growling]\n\nWhy is he called Bender?\n\nBecause he bends things.\n\nWell, because he was programmed\n\nto bend things. Bend, yeah.\n\nConstructively.\n\nHe's Mexican actually, he was made in Mexico.\n\nRight. HO in Mexico.\n\nHe, um. Yes, with the help\n\nof inspector number five.\n\nRight, you have to know the show.\n\nIt runs all the time.\n\nYou can sleep to it.\n\nOr perhaps he's called Bender.\n\n'cause in Matt Groening's other show,\n\nthere was a character named Homer.\n\nSo there's gotta be a character\n\nthat people are gonna love whose name ends with er.\n\nHow many kids does Bender have?\n\nWho the hell knows?\n\nI don't know.\n\nNone, right?\n\n[buzzer rings]\n\nDoes he have any?\n\nHe doesn't breed.\n\nThis is for you, lovely.\n\nOh, this question is, how did Hermes get his groove back?\n\nWell, 'cause he was facing problems\n\nwith the bureaucracy organization.\n\nHe tried to straighten them out\n\nand taught them that when push comes to shove,\n\nyou gotta do what you love,\n\neven if it's not a good idea.\n\nYou requisitioned your groove back.\n\nRight. That's right.\n\nThat's right. What does the\n\nJ stand for in Fry's name?\n\nJohn? I don't know\n\nif it was ever addressed.\n\nI do know that it's a longstanding cartoon tradition\n\nto give a character the initial J.\n\nReally? Yeah,\n\nlike Rocket J. Squirrel.\n\nOh. Homer J. Simpson.\n\nBullwinkle J. Moose.\n\nPhilip J. Fry.\n\nIt's a, you know, a cartoon thing.\n\nYou wouldn't understand. [Phil and Lauren laughing]\n\nWhat ancient civilization did Bender become Pharaoh of?\n\nYipes, yipes, yipes.\n\nI feel like I have to go download that episode\n\nto answer that question.\n\nAmazonia?\n\nI feel embarrassed because I don't remember.\n\nI don't remember. I'm old.\n\nWhat do you want?\n\nWhat is the Nibbler's species secret power?\n\nYou got me on that one.\n\nI don't know. Why don't you help me?\n\nYou see me sitting here dying. [Lauren laughing]\n\n[Interviewer] He can wipe people's minds.\n\nSecret power?\n\nOh. He what Nibblican.\n\nWipe people's minds.\n\nHe can read white people's minds.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nI wish I could do that.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nWhat mathematical principle was made for Futurama?\n\nI don't know anything about math.\n\nWe'd have to ask David X. Cohen.\n\nYeah, we'd have to ask David X. Cohen.\n\nHe's our math genius. [buzzer sounding]\n\nShould I call him?\n\nHe has a math club that meets once a week\n\nand they just solve problems.\n\nWhat are you doing?\n\nI was looking for my phone. Oh.\n\nTo call David X. Cohen. This isn't phone a friend.\n\nWe don't have that here.\n\nOh, we don't have? No.\n\nWhat was the original title for Futurama?\n\nHmm.\n\nYou said it was named Wasn't it always\n\njust Futurama? After that ride.\n\nThat was the name of the ride,\n\nand that's the name of the show.\n\nBut I don't know what the original title of the show was.\n\nSimpsons in Space? No.\n\nNo.\n\nI love that you went to all this trouble\n\nto make these cards that we're just\n\nThey looks so nice. Throwing on the floor.\n\nWhere does Fry work?\n\nHe delivers pizzas.\n\nHe works at Panucci's Pizza.\n\nPlanet Express.\n\nOh, but in the future\n\nhe delivers things to people in a spaceship.\n\nOh, he works for the Planet Express.\n\nPlanet Express.\n\nThank you. That was an easy one.\n\nWhat if Fry stayed in the past?\n\nI don't know what if any of us stayed.\n\nHe'd be in a bad mood\n\n'cause he was not happy about his life.\n\nNo, he was not. Back in the past\n\nbefore he froze.\n\nNo, he was not.\n\nAnd what if I stayed in the past?\n\nI don't know.\n\nBut if I had done anything different,\n\nnone of us would be here.\n\nThat's right. How many times\n\nhas he died, Fry?\n\nOh gosh, I don't know.\n\nI don't know the answer to that.\n\nDo you?\n\nHas he ever?\n\n[Interviewer] At least 22 times.\n\nWhat, really?\n\n[buzzer rings]\n\nYeah, I like that.\n\nThat does seem like a lot.\n\nWow. I like that.\n\nWhat does Scruffy read?\n\nOh, I think he'd read girly magazines.\n\nRight, some girly magazine.\n\nYeah, he reads girly magazines.\n\nWell, good for him.\n\nGood for him.\n\nHe's not one of our best employees.\n\nIs Zoidberg ever a good doctor?\n\nNo.\n\nDefine good. But,\n\nand he's definitely never a well paid doctor.\n\nNo, and I think the funniest thing about him\n\nis that he's a doctor, and he's poor.\n\nThat's hellaciously funny. And an alien\n\nand working on bodies differently than his planet.\n\nYes, that's hellaciously funny to me,\n\nthat he's a doctor and he's poor.\n\nI never met a poor doctor in my life.\n\nIt's probably cause he gets paid in food, not money.\n\nWhat role does Kif play in Zapp's missions?\n\nWell, Kif is sort of a.\n\nSecond in command, right?.\n\nA second in command, under officer,\n\nan errand boy, you know, just.\n\nMy Kiffy.\n\nYeah, he gets demeaned by Zapp Brannigan,\n\nwho is lout, deliciously stupid.\n\nHe's very much fun to play because he's that way.\n\nWho killed Agnew?\n\nNah, I don't know.\n\n[buzzer dings]\n\nI don't remember.\n\nOh, you can, you can, this is a big reveal.\n\nYou tell us what this.\n\nOh, this question. Wait till you hear this.\n\nThis question is, why does Hermes hate Zoidberg?\n\nGood question, why?\n\nWhy do you hate me so much?\n\nBecause you are a stinky lobster.\n\nWell, he doesn't, I don't think he hates Zoidberg,\n\nbut he just doesn't like Zoidberg.\n\nNobody likes Zoidberg.\n\nI like Zoidberg.\n\nDon't lie to Zoidberg.\n\nNobody, I said.\n\nThey only liked the stupid fryer, the robot.\n\nYeah, Amy wasn't even gonna marry him.\n\nThat's true.\n\nI had a girlfriend, but she couldn't smell.\n\nThat's why I had a girlfriend.\n\nYeah, Hermes has problems with Zoidbergs\n\nbecause he's an inefficient employee.\n\nThere'd be no drama.\n\nYou know, we need that stuff.\n\nWe need the through lines\n\nand the emotional resonance between the characters.\n\nDo I sound like I know what I'm talking about?\n\n[Lauren laughing]\n\nAlways.\n\nThose are all the questions.\n\nCan I keep this? [cross talking]\n\nWhy, you gonna put your lunch in it?\n\nYes.\n\nI just wanna take the lighting home with me.\n\nI wish I could just walk around with that.\n\nI wanna find a food truck.\n\nAll episodes are now streaming\n\nOn Hulu and Disney Plus\n\nAnd New Season's starting on September 15th.\n\nThanks for watching.
