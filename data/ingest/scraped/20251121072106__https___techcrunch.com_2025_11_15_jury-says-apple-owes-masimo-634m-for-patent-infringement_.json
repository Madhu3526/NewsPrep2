  "text": "A federal jury in California ruled Friday that Apple must pay medical device maker Masimo $634 million for infringing a patent on blood oxygen-monitoring technology.\n\nReuters reports the jury found that the Apple Watch’s workout mode and heart rate notification features violated Masimo’s patent.\n\n“This is a significant win in our ongoing efforts to protect our innovations and intellectual property, which is crucial to our ability to develop technology that benefits patients,” Masimo said in a statement. “We remain committed to defending our IP rights moving forward.”\n\nAn Apple spokesperson said in a statement that the verdict is “contrary to the facts” and that Apple plans to appeal.\n\n“Masimo is a medical device company that does not sell any products to consumers,” the spokesperson said. “Over the past six years they have sued Apple in multiple courts and asserted over 25 patents, the majority of which have been found to be invalid. The single patent in this case expired in 2022, and is specific to historic patient monitoring technology from decades ago.”\n\nThe legal dispute between Masimo and Apple focuses on pulse oximetry, which uses an optical sensor to detect blood flow. Masimo has accused Apple of hiring away its employees — including its chief medical officer — and infringing its patents on pulse oximetry technology.\n\nThe U.S. International Trade Commission sided by Masimo in 2023, banning Apple from importing Apple Watches with blood oxygen-monitoring features — which is why Apple Watches have not supported blood oxygen monitoring in recent years.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

San Francisco | WAITLIST NOW\n\nThen Apple announced in August of this year that it’s introducing a new version of the feature designed to circumvent the ban, with blood oxygen readings measured and calculated on the user’s paired iPhone, rather than on the Apple Watch itself.\n\nMasimo is suing U.S. Customs and Border Protection for approving the import of Apple Watches with the new blood oxygen implementation, while Apple has asked an appeals court to overturn the import ban.\n\nApple also countersued Masimo, winning the statutory minimum payment of $250 when a jury found that Masimo had violated Apple design patents.\n\nThis post has been updated with more details from Apple’s statement.",
