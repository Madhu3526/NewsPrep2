  "text": "The UK’s response to Covid was “too little, too late”, a damning official report on the handling of the pandemic has concluded, saying the introduction of a lockdown even a week earlier than happened could have saved more than 20,000 lives.\n\nThe document also has stinging criticism of a “toxic and chaotic” culture inside Boris Johnson’s Downing Street – which it said the then prime minister actively embraced.\n\nIt was an environment where the loudest voices held sway and women were sidelined, the report said.\n\nThe idea that a lockdown should not have happened in the circumstances was false, the authors said. Not having one would have caused loss of life “on a scale that was unconscionable and unacceptable”.\n\nDetailed in more than 750 pages across two volumes, the findings of the second part of the Covid inquiry’s hearings on how the government handled the pandemic paint a consistent picture of delay, inaction and an apparent inability to learn lessons.\n\nThe account of the start of the pandemic in early 2020 is particularly brutal, describing February as “a lost month”. It questions why Johnson did not chair a single meeting of the Cobra emergency committee, noting also that the response to Covid essentially halted during the half-term holiday week.\n\nIf a lockdown had been imposed on 16 March, a week earlier than took place, modelling suggests this could have cut the number of deaths in England in the first wave of the virus by almost half, equating to 23,000 lives saved, the inquiry authors say.\n\nView image in fullscreen If lockdown had been imposed a week earlier up to 23,000 lives could have been saved, the report says.

The report also targets the three devolved governments, and others central to the process, such as scientific advisers.\n\n“The inquiry finds that the response of the four governments repeatedly amounted to a case of ‘too little, too late’,” it reads. “The failure to appreciate the scale of the threat, or the urgency of response it demanded, meant that by the time the possibility of a mandatory lockdown was first considered it was already too late and a lockdown had become unavoidable.”\n\nMany of the same mistakes – reacting too slowly and underestimating the speed and impact of Covid’s spread – were then repeated later in 2020, as restrictions were lifted and then belatedly reimposed in the face of infectious new strains, the report adds, calling this “inexcusable”.\n\nOther findings include:\n\nStrong criticism of Chris Wormald, who was the head civil servant at the health department and is now Keir Starmer’s cabinet secretary. The report said he had failed to correct the “over-enthusiastic impression” of the department’s work given by Matt Hancock, the then health secretary, and had failed to properly look into widespread doubts about Hancock’s effectiveness.\n\nThat while lockdowns were needed, they left “lasting scars” on society, particularly for children.\n\nIf ministers had acted swiftly with other measures to curb the spread of the virus, a complete lockdown might have been avoided, or at least have been shorter.\n\nCommunication with the devolved nations was poor, and the leaders of all the UK countries made errors.\n\nView image in fullscreen The actions of the devolved governments, including in Scotland, were also criticised.

February 2020 was a lost month.”\n\nWhile there is nothing to mandate that Cobra is always chaired by a PM, it was “surprising” that Johnson did not do this before March, the authors say, with some understatement.\n\n“Mr Johnson should have appreciated sooner that this was an emergency that required prime ministerial leadership to inject urgency into the response,” concludes the inquiry, chaired by the retired judge and cross-bench peer Heather Hallett.\n\nThis was explained in part by the PM “acting in accordance with his own optimistic disposition” and accepting assurances that everything necessary was being done.\n\nDuring the February half-term, Johnson spent the whole week at the government’s Chevening country retreat, the report says, adding: “It does not appear that he was briefed, at all or to any significant extent, on Covid-19 and he received no daily updates.”\n\nBy the second week of March, the report says, the situation was “little short of calamitous”, with no proper plan, no testing taking place and thus no understanding about how far the virus had spread.\n\nBut a lockdown was still delayed, in part because of warnings from the medical and scientific advisers for England, Chris Whitty and Patrick Vallance, about the likelihood of “behavioural fatigue”, meaning people would comply only for a period. This concept, the report said, “had no grounding in behavioural science and proved damaging, given the imperative to act more decisively and sooner”.\n\nView image in fullscreen A government billboard on Borough High Street, south London, during the third set of lockdown restrictions.

Ed Davey, the Lib Dem leader, said: “The British people will rightly never forgive the Conservatives for leaving the country rudderless and vulnerable, and for partying while our communities were isolated and grieving.”\n\nIn a written parliamentary statement, Starmer noted the failings, and also the context of the UK being not properly prepared. He wrote: “Since then, improvements have been made to the way the government would respond to a major crisis.”",
