It's one of the most common answers used in a job interview to spin the dreaded \"What's your weakness?\" into a humblebrag. For many, it's about striving for excellence or working tirelessly to reach the highest standard. But what happens when these high (and sometimes unrelenting) expectations of yourself are exactly what's holding you back? \"I know perfectionism is an illusion, but I am always trying to chase it,\" admits 25-year-old Aswan. Even in the workplace, she feels the pressure, \"I know that I can make a mistake and I won't lose my job, yet I constantly feel like I'm one strike away from being fired\".\n\nIt's an anxiety shared by many perfectionists, says health psychologist Dr Sula Windgassen. Speaking on the BBC Sounds podcast Complex with Kimberley Wilson, she explains: \"Poor self-esteem tends to go hand in hand with perfectionism because there is this fear of failing\". That fear often fuels procrastination. Aswan remembers taking her driving theory test: \"I got so pent up about passing it first time that when I failed by a couple of points I've never tried to get it back.\" That was almost four years ago. Perfectionism can be rooted in personality, but childhood experiences, school environments, and parental expectations can also shape what we grow up believing is \"good enough\".\n\nBreaking the cycle\n\nWhile perfectionism isn't a clinical diagnosis, its effects are very real - from anxiety and tiredness to stress-related physical symptoms such as a weakened immune system. Still, experts say the cycle can be broken. Dr Windgassen suggests beginning what's known in psychology as a behavioural experiment. It starts by asking yourself what you think will happen if the outcome isn't perfect - writing down your predictions, and then testing them in real time. Was the outcome as bad as you expected? And what positive things came from this new approach? It might be that you manage to go to sleep at 10pm rather than 1am, leaving you feeling more refreshed.\n\nOver the years, Dayna says she has learned to quiet her harsh inner critic\n\nFor 26-year-old Dayna, who describes herself as a \"former perfectionist\", it's a trait she is relieved to have left behind. She once sacrificed her wellbeing in pursuit of flawless results and it's something she never wants to repeat. \"I kept a journal to gain more self-awareness about my tendencies and read self-help books,\" says Dayna. \"I had to learn the hard way how to develop coping mechanisms and strategies to not sacrifice everything and that being a perfectionist is not a noble quality as I used to think it might be.\" At times, her harsh inner critic took over and eventually the path to perfectionism led to burnout. Looking back, Dayna remembers feeling chronically anxious and stressed.",
