  "title": "“It Just Works”: How Windows on Snapdragon Raises the PC Bar",
  "text": "It’s the great, universal frustration of computing: You’re trying to finish a project, but your laptop just isn’t working, and you can’t do much about it. Maybe the battery is draining too rapidly, maybe apps are glitching, maybe certain use cases are slowing performance to a crawl. In any case, that familiar feeling of disappointment is the same.\n\nThat fatigue makes users overly cautious, always heading off potential problems—until they see that another way is possible. “For battery life, one of my tests was during a large meeting, when thirty of us were all at a round table,” says Devin Arthur, a system administrator. “Everyone’s getting their laptops out, and they’re all plugged in, and I’m thinking, ‘This is crazy. You bring your laptop because of the convenience, not to have to plug it in and get set up everywhere you go like it’s a desktop.’ I was in there with my Windows on Snapdragon, not plugged in, and everyone’s trying to tell me that my laptop’s going to die. I made them a bet that I could last the entire day without charging, and we’d see what happens. By the end of the day, they were all flabbergasted.”\n\nSimplicity, consistency, and reliability are essential for today’s computing; an exceptional user experience (UX) earns the trust that a device will do what it’s supposed to, whenever we need it. The superior computing foundation of Windows on Snapdragon makes this ideal a reality, raising the bar on personal computing with an intuitive ease of adoption, integration, and operation for Windows loyalists and converts alike. As some initial misgivings persist in the market, the advanced custom platform from Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. is dispelling fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD) with firsthand accounts of the noticeable difference. The seamless transition, dependable performance, on-chip AI, and elevated tech specs of Windows on Snapdragon are turning skeptical prospective users into true believers.\n\n“I work for a large company with offices worldwide,” explains Arthur. “We were recently investigating laptops with Windows’ new architecture in terms of power use, power efficiency benefits. I’ve been using one for the last six or seven months at work, and I’ve heard the misconceptions. People think it won’t run your apps, won’t do this or that. But my first reaction was, wow, this works. There’s your quote: It just works.”\n\nWindows on Snapdragon presents a welcoming, ready-to-use step forward for computing, an architecture sophisticated in its makeup yet uncomplicated in its interface. Those migrating from other platforms have found the changeover to be fluid and free of obstacles, while those upgrading from previous iterations of Windows feel the benefits. “For the majority of users, the quality of the experience now is such that they won’t have to adapt to the difference between running Windows wherever else and running Windows on Snapdragon,” says Geoff Blaber, CEO at CCS Insight.\n\nThe most perceptible change in Windows on Snapdragon—the long-lasting battery life holding a charge up to 22 hours—doesn’t require any acclimation on the user’s part. They can continue working as they’re used to or break free of current restrictions knowing that the high standard of performance will hold steady even when devices are unconnected to a power source. “You can shut it, put it in a case, stuff it in a bag, come back to it two days later, and you’ve still got the charge,” says Sascha Krohn, Global Technical PR Director for ASUS. “The crazy thing is that Qualcomm’s actual power consumption is about 33% less than advertised. It’s even better than they’re saying.”\n\nWith a long-lasting battery, our laptops come through when we need them most. “When we were hit by Hurricane Helene last October, I didn’t have power at my house, and I had to make my way on a dirt bike through debris to get to parts of town with power and Internet,” recalls Olivier Blanchard, Research Director for the Futurum Group. “My Dell XPS 13 laptop with the Snapdragon® X Elite chip on it was the smallest PC I had. Because I was out there for a long time, I put it in a power-efficient configuration, and I was getting crazy battery life out of it with a lot of work, lots of tabs open, using Google Docs to write, all these things. All-day battery life, no problem.”\n\n“Where I really started to see a difference was in remote work,” says Jessica Naziri, Editor-in-Chief of TechSesh. “I could go to coffeeshops, outdoors, and there was barely any heat. No fans, and this is outside in the sun. Knowing I can go wherever without carrying a charger with me, that was a big shift. I realized Windows on Snapdragon isn’t just for casual users. Tech, creatives, they can get what they need from this platform.”\n\nOne of the major benefits of the Snapdragon platform is its stellar on-device AI, allowing users to access Copilot+ without routing their data to an online cloud. “For me, the big thing is the AI from Copilot+,” Naziri adds. “It fits into the platform so well, the processing is strong, and everything’s happening locally on the device. I like that everything’s private, I like that it’s not cloud-based, and it’s just made my searching so much better. It really has changed how I work. I don’t have to rely on the internet to process.”\n\nThe privacy of on-device AI is just one part of an overall emphasis on cybersecurity in Windows on Snapdragon, a high priority for a user base working with proprietary, sensitive information. “There’s a closed, very secure section of the chip that handles credentials,” explains Krohn,. “To us, that’s a good thing.”\n\nEvery aspect of the Snapdragon platform has been designed with the end user in mind, including app compatibility. As the Cofounder of Counterpoint Research, Neil Shah works with nearly 150 analysts, and they need to know that they can continue using the apps they depend on if they’re going to adopt a new platform. The percentage of Counterpointers shifting over to devices powered by Snapdragon has doubled since last year in part because their apps shift along with them. “If you’re an analyst like me, and you live in the Microsoft ecosystem, you need applications like Dropbox, Teams, Slack,” Shah says. “And on my team, we felt a big difference, moving from Intel to Snapdragon. Native apps are really good, emulation is even better than in previous Windows generations. Microsoft and Qualcomm Technologies have them running really smoothly.”\n\nFor professionals in supervisory tech positions at the enterprise level, minimizing friction for employees is a matter of intelligent configuration and management for devices. PCs with Snapdragon make it easy for IT teams to set up, troubleshoot, and update laptops. “If it’s supported by Microsoft and Intune, which Windows on Snapdragon is, then enterprises are going to have no problem with management of devices,” says Patrick Moorhead, CEO, Founder, and Chief Analyst at Moor Insights. “If they’re sticking to what they did 15 years ago, that’s probably not going to be the case.”\n\nThe peace of mind that comes from devices working as they should is at the heart of the advantage Snapdragon provides. Whether it’s battery life freeing users from constant charging, AI operating on-device, or apps built for the platform, everything contributes to a fluid experience that takes the headaches out of computing. “I fired up a brand-new Windows on Snapdragon device and I didn’t have to search for anything,” says Moorhead. “And the cool part about some of these updates to Windows is that you can back everything up on your old PC, and you have the option to copy all your applications and they update right to the native version. It just worked.”\n\nSnapdragon branded products are products of Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. and/or its subsidiaries.\n\nBattery life varies significantly based on device, settings, usage, and other factors.",
