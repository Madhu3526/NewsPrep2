Add the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil to the bowl of leaves and season lightly with salt and pepper, then toss thoroughly until all the leaves are coated, separating any that are stuck together. Scatter the leaves over the baking sheet, then return it to the oven and roast until the leaves are bright green and crispy in places and the cores are caramelized all over, 10 to 15 minutes.",
