  "title": "Roasted Winter Squash With Citrus Chile Crisp Recipe",
  "text": "This dish turns squash into the star of the table. The wedges roast until caramelized and tender, then get layered over a tangy bed of citrusy yogurt that cuts through their sweetness. The chile crisp — a mixture of shallots and garlic fried in oil until just golden then finished with crushed red pepper, sesame, paprika and lots of fresh zest from lemon and orange — brings heat, crunch and brightness all at once. Make the crisp ahead, holding off on the zest until the last minute, and you’ll find yourself spooning it over grilled chicken, a bowl of brothy beans, roasted potatoes, or really anything that could use a hit of spice and texture.",
