  "text": "Straddling Italy and Austria, the Dolomite Mountains blend three languages, two identities and one breathtaking landscape – but their delicate balance is being tested\n\nIn the shadow of the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, the old military road from Rifugio Auronzo led me along a clifftop path marked by rockfalls. On an exposed curve was a lonely stone chapel, the Maria Ausiliatrice Madonna della Croda Church. Built in 1917, I read. A few metres away was a monument built by the Bersaglieri, Italy's elite infantry corps, to commemorate the fallen during World War One. It was imbued with a sense of loss, with fresh-cut flowers placed at the altar, and I ran my hands over the cold stone.\n\nAmong the rubble nearby was another monument. But this one was smaller and dedicated to Austrian mountaineer Paul Grohmann, who, 60 years before, had made the first ascent of Cima Grande, the battlement-like mountain I was standing below. It was a quiet celebration of bygone Austrian heroism.\n\nTragedy. Triumph. The complicated history of these borderland mountains was suddenly tangible in the rocks at my feet.\n\nOnce, the Tre Cime di Lavaredo (also known as the Drei Zinnen) and the Sexten Dolomites were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. For more than 550 years, until 1918, the regions that now form Trentino-Alto Adige/South Tyrol, Belluno in Veneto and part of Friuli-Venezia Giulia belonged to the Habsburgs. Since their transfer in 1919 as part of territorial gains following the end of WW1, they have been ruled by Italy.",
