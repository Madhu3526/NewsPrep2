  "title": "'The blight seeped into your soul': How Seven reflected fears in the US in the 1980s",
  "text": "Thirty years after its release, David Fincher's Seven is now celebrated as the zenith of neo-noir crime thrillers. It raked in a whopping $327m (£250m) at the box office on a $34m (£26m) budget and earned raves from most critics when it came out in 1995. Still, the persistent argument against the film is that it relies too heavily on shock-and-awe gruesomeness to distract from its paper-thin ideas and shopworn crime tropes. A Washington Post critic lambasted Seven for disguising \"formulaic writing\" with gratuitous \"bloodletting\", while a New York Times reviewer lamented that \"not even bags of body parts… keep it from being dull\".\n\nWarning: This article contains descriptions of violence that some may find offensive.\n\nThree decades on, however, it's clear that some critics missed a different layer to the film – namely, how it interpreted the US's social crises of the 1980s. There was a worldwide recession at the start of the decade, and this coincided with high urban crime rates, a crack cocaine epidemic and the spread of Aids. The US's new president, Ronald Reagan, responded to these issues with talk of being \"tough on crime\", and his high-profile supporters included various influential Christian figures – leaders of what was known as the Christian right or the religious right – who preached the importance of traditional family values.\n\nAll of this fed into Seven. On one level, the film is an exquisitely well-made thriller about a psychopathic serial killer, but beneath its noir-style veneer lies a fascinating take on the way the US responded to some of its most divisive social issues.",
