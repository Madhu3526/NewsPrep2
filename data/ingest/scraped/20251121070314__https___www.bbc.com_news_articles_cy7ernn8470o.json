  "text": "Mural gives 94-year-old woman 'dream garden'\n\nThe mural, which features flowers and insects, makes the owner feel like she is sitting in a garden\n\nA 94-year-old woman says a huge mural painted on the side of her house gives her a \"dream garden\" that she \"doesn't need to look after\".\n\nMuriel Baker, from Meare near Glastonbury in Somerset, had her wall transformed into a countryside scene.\n\nShe cannot manage the weeding or watering needed for a garden, but this option lets her feel as though she's sitting in one while enjoying a coffee or tea, she added.\n\nIt is the second mural she has had painted on her house, which she says \"attracts people from all over\".",
