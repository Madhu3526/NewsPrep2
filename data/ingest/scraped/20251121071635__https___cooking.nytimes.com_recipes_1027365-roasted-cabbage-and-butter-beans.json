  "text": "Ribbons of cabbage are roasted until they are sweet and caramelized then tossed with butter beans, garlic and anchovies and finished with fresh parsley; the details make this dish surprisingly flavorful for such a simple ingredient list. An easy and affordable way to get dinner on the table, this recipe makes a hearty main dish served with hunks of crusty bread, or a hardworking side dish next to your favorite protein. If you cannot find butter beans, cannellini beans make a perfect (though smaller) substitute. If you are seeking a vegetarian alternative, a few tablespoons of chopped capers make a great substitute for the flavor that the anchovies add.",
