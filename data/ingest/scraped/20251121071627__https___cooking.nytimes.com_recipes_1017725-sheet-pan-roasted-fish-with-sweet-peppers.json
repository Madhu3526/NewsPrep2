  "text": "I made this tonight for my wife and me. It was wonderful. I used a ceramic rectangular Emile Henri casserole dish rather than a rimmed sheet pan. I was only making enough for two and it was large enough to do the trick. Plus, it looked great when brought to the table. Oh, I substituted cod for the hake. And I am now a NYT subscriber. I like your news pages but when I have read ten stories I am done. I hit your cooking pages almost every day. I came for the news, I stayed for the recipes.\n\nIs this helpful? 282",
