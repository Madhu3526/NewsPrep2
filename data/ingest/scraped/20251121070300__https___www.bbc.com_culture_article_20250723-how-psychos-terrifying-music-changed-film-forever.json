  "text": "Alfred Hitchcock's grisly horror, which turns 65 this month, might not have become known as an-all time classic without the crucial addition of Bernard Herrmann's disturbing score.\n\nScreaming violas that sound like they're coming out of an abattoir. Thumping bass notes, which slowly decrease in speed and seem to imitate a victim's faltering heartbeat. Take away composer Bernard Herrmann's score for director Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho, which turns 65 this month, and it's fair to say this 1960 horror film wouldn't have the same nerve-shredding impact.\n\nParticularly key is the knives-edge music that plays when blonde bombshell Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), not long after checking in to the Bates Motel, is attacked through a shower curtain by a shadowy killer, who later turns out to be the motel's owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), dressed up as his dead mother. \"That music is everything,\" says Rachel Zeffira, a film composer and one half of art-folk duo Cat's Eyes. \"It's the birds, it's the bees, and it's the voices in the back of your head.\"\n\nAlamy Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in Psycho – leading up to the shower scene that had a profound effect on audiences and cinema (Credit: Alamy)\n\nThe project had seemed ill-starred from the start, with executives at Paramount (who had produced Hitchcock's previous five films) showing little interest, not allowing him to film it on their lot, and only distributing it rather than producing it themselves. But despite a paltry budget, Hitchcock proved everybody wrong, and for that he could partly thank Herrmann and his knack for crafting compositions that lifted scenes to new heights.",
