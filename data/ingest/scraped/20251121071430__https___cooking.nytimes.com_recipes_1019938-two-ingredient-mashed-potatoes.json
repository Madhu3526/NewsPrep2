  "text": "Cooked recipe as written, even peeling the potatoes, which I almost never do. Had to cook the potatoes at least five minutes more than recipe. After I smashed the potatoes, added the full fat plain Greek yogurt, and added about 1/2 cup of the saved potato water, I had two responses: it had waaay too much salt! Ack! And the result of the yogurt and added potato water did not give me, as it gave others a \"potato-y\" taste, it just tasted thin, and too salty. I added unsalted butter - about 3 T - which gave it a little creaminess. I will not try this again.\n\nIs this helpful? 1",
