  "text": "After YouTube discontinued its private messaging feature in 2019, the platform is now reintroducing this functionality for a select group of users.\n\nUsers with access to the test are able to share videos directly on the mobile app, including long-form videos, Shorts, and even livestreams.\n\nThey’ll be able to tap the Share button to open a full-screen chat within the app, allowing them to start a private one-on-one conversation or a group chat. Friends can reply with a video of their own, or simply type a response or use emojis.\n\nThe test is now available to users who are 18 and older in Ireland and Poland, the company says.\n\nThis is exciting news for many, as currently, the only way to share YouTube videos is through text, email, WhatsApp, iMessage, Instagram DMs, or other messaging platforms. The company noted that in-app messaging has been a “top feature request.”\n\nWhen the messaging feature was first removed, the rationale behind the decision was not fully explained. It was speculated that the feature had become underutilized, a common fate for many features that are eventually discontinued.\n\nAnother possibility could be that younger users frequently utilize this feature, which could be problematic for a platform frequently scrutinized for inappropriate content, as well as concerns about child exploitation and predatory behavior.\n\nThis concern regarding children could be why YouTube has chosen to restrict the test to adult users this time, and it may influence the decision to maintain similar restrictions if the feature is rolled out more broadly in the future.\n\nYouTube is also implementing standard safety features, including requiring users to send each other invites prior to initiating a chat, as well as the ability to unsend messages, block others, and report conversations.\n\nYouTube will also review messages to ensure they follow the same Community Guidelines that apply to videos and comments on the platform.\n\nThe experiment follows a similar feature launched by Spotify in August.",
