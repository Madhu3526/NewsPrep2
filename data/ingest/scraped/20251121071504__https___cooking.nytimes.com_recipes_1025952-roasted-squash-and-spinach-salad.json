  "text": "An ideal salad for chillier nights, this hearty, dinner-friendly salad comes together in the time it takes for the spiced butternut squash to roast. To reduce prep work, the squash is simply halved then roasted, so you can easily scoop out pieces after cooking rather than chopping the firm vegetable beforehand. Cumin and coriander season the sweet squash, adding an earthy, warming flavor to the dish. While the squash roasts, you’ll prepare a simple feta-yogurt dressing that draws on the sweet acidity of freshly squeezed orange juice. The scooped squash and sweet, tender onions are tossed with the dressing and spinach, plus a sprinkle of crunchy sunflower seeds, for a bright and satisfying meal.",
