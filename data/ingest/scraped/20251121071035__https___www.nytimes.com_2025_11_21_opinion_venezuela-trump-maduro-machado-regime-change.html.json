  "text": "Over the past few weeks, the forward momentum of the U.S. aggression seemed — temporarily at least — to have stalled. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the driving force behind the thrust for regime change, has played down the possibility of a ground invasion. The recent arrival of the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Gerald R. Ford and its battle group in the Caribbean, and reports of a flurry of meetings in Washington, led to some frantic speculation that the long-awaited ground strikes were imminent. But President Trump’s subsequent statement that the administration “may be having some discussions with Maduro” let the air out of the balloon once again.\n\nMr. Rubio has a close, longstanding connection to the uncompromising faction of the Venezuelan opposition headed by the Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado, who is currently in hiding. He is also keen to rid the hemisphere of leftist dictators. If we are then to take Mr. Rubio’s recent comments and Mr. Trump’s stated aversion to foreign military entanglements at face value — not to mention that of the MAGA base — the administration appears to be engaged in a kind of phony war: one that doesn’t require American boots on Venezuelan soil, but that is convincing enough either to scare Mr. Maduro into fleeing or to persuade his own military to topple him.\n\nMs. Machado and her closest allies have for years tried to persuade outside powers — the United States in particular — to intervene militarily against the Maduro regime, with little success. Mr. Trump’s return to office offered a fresh opportunity. Ms. Machado and her allies sought to build a case that Mr. Maduro posed a clear and present danger to the United States, rooted in three issues that resonated with the Trump administration: drugs, migration and terrorism. There is no public evidence to support the claim that Mr. Maduro is the head of a military-run drug cartel, but it contains enough half-truths to make it politically useful.\n\nThe gunboat diplomacy the Trump administration may have hoped would be a shortcut to bloodless regime change does not appear to be working. Mr. Maduro could well be losing sleep over the possibility of a targeted strike, a Special Operations snatch squad or even a full-scale intervention; he claims to have mobilized millions of militia members. But the safest outcome for those in Mr. Maduro’s inner circle is to remain in power. Any officers who might be privately keen to overthrow him would be reluctant to install Ms. Machado, their sworn enemy, in the presidency, and know full well the fate that awaits them if they fall afoul of Mr. Maduro’s security services.\n\nAs the world awaits Mr. Trump’s next move, there are broadly speaking two main directions this could go. Either the U.S. fleet disperses, presumably after demonstrating its firepower on some terrestrial targets as a token show of force, and leaves Mr. Maduro in power, or the Trump administration succeeds in toppling the government, with or without landing U.S. troops on Venezuelan soil.",
