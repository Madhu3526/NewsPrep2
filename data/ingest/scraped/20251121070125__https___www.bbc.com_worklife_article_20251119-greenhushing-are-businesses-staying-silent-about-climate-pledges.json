  "title": "'Greenhushing': Are businesses staying silent about climate pledges?",
  "text": "With Trump's call to \"drill, baby drill\" and sweeping changes to environmental policies, it's been suggested that some companies are talking less about their climate pledges. But the truth behind the trend is much more complicated than it first seems.\n\nIt happened gradually, then suddenly.\n\nAn alliance of banks dedicated to cutting greenhouse gas emissions lost some of its biggest members near the start of the year, just before Donald Trump took office. A few months later the Net Zero Banking Alliance abandoned its most ambitious goal, a pledge to limit global warming to 1.5C.\n\nThen in early October the alliance, which was set up in 2021 and had nearly 150 corporate members at its peak, voted to disband entirely.\n\nOn the surface its dissolution seemed linked to the sweeping changes in environmental policy filtering down from the White House - Trump’s exhortations to \"drill, baby, drill\" and the Republican Party’s battle against \"woke\" companies and institutions.",
