  "title": "WIRED Roundup: DHS’s Privacy Breach, AI Romantic Affairs, and Google Sues Text Scammers",
  "text": "Even if you win this lawsuit, it's not like someone's going to go knocking on the door of a bunch of scammers in China and say, \"Hey, give us the restitution, go to jail.\" But what I thought was interesting is there are some, as Matt noted in his piece, there are some knock-on effects. At the very least, if you can prove that these people are doing this in court then you can maybe get some traction with the platforms they're working with, maybe get some traction with other third-party infrastructure that is being used by this group to cut off avenues for them to operate. I don't know how successful that will be, I don't think the number of texts I'm getting is going to go down, but it's not quite as hopeless as it may first appear.\n\nZoë Schiffer: I thought it was telling that they didn't name the individuals that they're suing, but they did put their Telegram handles in the filing.\n\nBrian Barrett: Yeah, exactly.\n\nZoë Schiffer: I would say that they should get some help with the copywriting of the templates, because I have not found these scams to be so convincing, but given that they've made over a billion dollars, perhaps I'm wrong.\n\nBrian Barrett: Maybe we're writing our stories wrong. I think maybe we got to pick up that scammer cadence.\n\nZoë Schiffer: It's true. One more before we go to break, and this one is about chatbots. Specifically it's about people having intense romantic relationships with chatbots and then getting divorced as a result. Our colleague Jason Parham wrote a story this week about a new legal frontier that is emerging in family law. Basically an AI affair is now grounds for divorce.\n\nBrian Barrett: So much to unpack here, Zoë. We've written a lot about people who are in serious relationships with AI, and that is a real thing that is happening. It honestly had not occurred to me, I'm so glad Jason wrote this, about the legal implications. Because you do in a lot of states, you need to say why you're getting divorced to get the divorce granted, and is this an affair? Is it an addiction to a computer program? Is it both? Which is a thorny thing to try to figure out in the middle of what is a really hard and confusing time in people's lives anyway. So, I don't envy anyone in this situation or the divorce lawyers who have to fight over it.",
