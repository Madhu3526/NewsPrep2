  "title": "Lemon Roasted Potatoes With Smoked Paprika and Rosemary Recipe",
  "text": "A potato doesn’t need much else other than oil, salt and a hot oven to be truly delicious. But dust them with smokey paprika, and roast them alongside tangy lemon slices on a bed of woodsy rosemary, and you have some truly special potatoes. A large and waxy potato is best here (Yukon Golds especially), but know that a starchy potato like an Idaho would also work; just expect something fluffier with less crispiness.",
