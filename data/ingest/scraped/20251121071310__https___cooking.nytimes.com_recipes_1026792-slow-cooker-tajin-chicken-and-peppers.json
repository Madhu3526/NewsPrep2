  "text": "This easy braise is generously spiked with Tajín, the chile-lime salt that is often sprinkled on fresh fruit but can also be used as a punchy, one-stop seasoning for grilled chicken and salads. You can eat the stew in bowls, with tortilla chips on the side, or on top of rice, or use a slotted spoon to tuck it into tortillas for tacos, burritos or enchiladas. Mild or hot cans of roasted, chopped green chiles are usually stocked near the canned chipotles and pickled jalapeños, and are a versatile pantry item to have on hand.",
