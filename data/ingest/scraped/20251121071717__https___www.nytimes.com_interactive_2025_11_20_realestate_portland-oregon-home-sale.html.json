  "text": "Jamie McPartland and Peter Oviatt met 23 years ago in New York City, though neither was from the area. She had come from California, he from Ohio, and they found in each other a similar yen for travel and adventure.\n\nThe couple flickered through odd jobs — watering office plants, bookkeeping, restaurant work — before earning graduate degrees: Mr. Oviatt has a doctorate in anthropology from M.I.T.; Ms. McPartland earned a master’s in creative writing from the New School. After they married and had a daughter — Oksana, now 9 — they continued to seek out wisdom through travel, living in Airbnbs and sublets for months at a time during her early childhood.\n\n[Did you recently buy a home?

Their travels led them to France, where Mr. Oviatt studied truffle cultivation; Turkey and Morocco, where they waited out visa requirements; and southern Oregon, where Ms. McPartland’s parents had moved. She created a hand-drawn logbook for Oksana titled “Places You’ve Slept.”\n\n“I liked living a transient life. I thought it was the best,” Ms. McPartland said. “But then I realized it wasn’t good for my daughter. I started to long for a home we would stay in forever and have whatever forever is.”",
