  "text": "Whether crowdsurfing inside a giant condom or singing alongside a vulva-headed dancer, Peaches has left us with some indelible on-stage images over the years – and there are set to be a few new ones as she goes on tour and releases her first album in a decade. As she does so, she’ll join us to answer your questions.\n\nPeaches, AKA Merrill Nisker, emerged from Toronto’s underground scene in the late 1990s – her peers included Feist, her flatmate above a sex shop – but really came to fame in the early 00s after she moved to Berlin. Her debut EP, Lovertits, was a cherished item on the era’s electroclash scene but it was the a joyous, profane dance-punk track Fuck the Pain Away, from her debut album The Teaches of Peaches, that really took her into the mainstream.\n\nIt began a run of brilliantly named albums – Fatherfucker, Impeach My Bush, I Feel Cream and Rub – graced by the likes of Iggy Pop, Soulwax and Kim Gordon, but there’s been a long gap since the last of those in 2015. Thankfully, the follow-up No Lube So Rude is set for release in 2026, and the first single Not In Your Mouth None of Your Business is a complete triumph: a pounding manifesto for liberation and resistance aimed at anyone trying to strip away queer rights. Peaches is also going on a 27-date North American tour from February, donating a dollar from every ticket to organisations upholding trans rights.\n\nShe has enough amazing music and globetrotting experiences to fill multiple lifetimes, so please post your questions on it all in the comments below before 1pm GMT on Tuesday 18 November. We’ll publish her answers in the 21 November edition of the Film & Music section, as well as online.",
