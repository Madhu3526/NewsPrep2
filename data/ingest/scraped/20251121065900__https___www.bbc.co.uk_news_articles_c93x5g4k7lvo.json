  "text": "While Jen says she first fell in love with charity shops and the gems hidden within them when she was 17, her love of rummaging actually started much earlier.\n\n\"My dad told me that when I was five or six years old he used to take me to the scrapyard where they sold clothes, bric-a-brac and bits of furniture,\" says Jen, who grew up in the Anfield area of Liverpool and now lives in Sandbach, Cheshire.\n\n\"I used to love going there and I would buy the most random stuff.\n\n\"I loved going there more than I loved going to a toy shop!\"\n\nEncouraged by her elder daughter, Jen started sharing styling tips on social media.\n\nIt was a move born out of necessity as well as passion, though, after she lost her job.\n\n\"I was doing like one item three ways, and how I would wear this item and where I got it from and how much it was,\" she says.\n\nAs her following began to grow, she started sharing the gems she had discovered while sifting through the rails at charity shops.\n\n\"It just took off from there,\" says Jen.\n\nHer top discoveries include a YSL blazer for just £20, a Coach jacket for £30 and a Hermes purse for £25 as well as clothes from her favourite brands such as Jaeger and Frank Usher.",
