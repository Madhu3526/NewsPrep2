  "text": "Buying cocaine on a Friday night in Britain can indirectly help Russian arms factories, the National Crime Agency (NCA) has warned.\n\nThe NCA said a man linked to a Russian-led money-laundering network operating in the UK had bought a bank in Kyrgyzstan which was used to make payments on behalf of the Russian war machine.\n\nSal Melki, the agency's Deputy Director for Economic Crime, said it was a \"vast criminal ecosystem that is funding some really bad things all around the world\".\n\nThe NCA is trying to disrupt the network from top to bottom, even putting adverts in UK motorway service station toilets to warn couriers carrying cash for the money-launderers of the lengthy jail sentences they face.",
