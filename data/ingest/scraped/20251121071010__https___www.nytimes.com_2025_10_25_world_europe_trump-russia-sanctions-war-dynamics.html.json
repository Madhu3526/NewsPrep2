  "title": "Trump’s Russia Sanctions Shift War Dynamics to the Energy Front",
  "text": "Far from the largely deadlocked front line on the battlefield, Russia and Ukraine are waging a fierce parallel war on each other’s energy assets that could do more to force them to the negotiating table than any flurry of international diplomacy.\n\nThis fight came into focus in recent days as the United States and Europe announced sweeping new sanctions on Russia’s oil industry, the lifeblood of the Kremlin’s war machine. Ukraine has been working to rally international action against Russia’s energy economy, while imposing what it calls its own “long-range sanctions”: drone strikes that have damaged dozens of Russian refineries.\n\nRussia’s target is the Ukrainian electricity and gas infrastructure, which it has attacked repeatedly in a devastating campaign as winter approaches. The objective, experts say, is to cripple Ukraine’s ability to function and sap its people’s will to abide the war.\n\nWhether either side will yield under economic pressure is uncertain. But each views its energy attacks, analysts say, as a strategic lever to break the stalemate in a conflict that has ground on for nearly four years and has so far been immune to the Trump administration’s peacemaking efforts.",
