  "text": "Alice and Ellen Kessler, identical twin sisters from Germany whose tightly choreographed song-and-dance routines wowed nightclub and variety show audiences around the world, died on Monday at their home in Grünwald, a suburb of Munich. They were 89.\n\nTheir death, by suicide, was confirmed by the German Society for Humane Dying, which provided assistance with the process. By their own account, they had long intended to end their lives together, and Ellen had recently suffered a serious stroke.\n\nBeginning as dancers at the famed Lido cabaret in Paris in 1955, the Kessler twins were part of the golden age of the trans-Atlantic nightclub circuit, performing on their own and alongside headliners like Frank Sinatra, Harry Belafonte and Fred Astaire.",
