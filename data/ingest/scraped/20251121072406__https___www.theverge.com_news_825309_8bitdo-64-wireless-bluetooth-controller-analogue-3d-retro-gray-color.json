  "text": "The retro gray version of the 8BitDo 64 controller makes me want an Analogue 3D.\n\nI’m deeply regretting skipping preorders for Analogue’s reimagined N64 console now that 8BitDo has updated its 64 Bluetooth controller with a new retro gray color scheme. At $45 it’s more expensive than the $40 black and white versions, but those colored buttons are hitting all my nostalgia buttons.",
