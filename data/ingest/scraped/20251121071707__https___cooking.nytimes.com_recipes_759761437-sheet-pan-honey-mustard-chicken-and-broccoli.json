  "title": "Sheet-Pan Honey Mustard Chicken and Broccoli Recipe",
  "text": "When a marinade does the heavy lifting, throwing together dinner turns into a breeze. This sweet, tangy honey-Dijon blend coats freshly chopped broccoli and skinless chicken thighs. The broccoli florets and stems are separated, and the stems are peeled and sliced into thin coins, which helps them cook at the same rate as the other ingredients. To ensure perfectly tender broccoli, the sheet pan gets tightly wrapped in aluminum foil to trap in steam. Once the chicken and broccoli are partially cooked, uncover, then douse in more honey mustard. This second round of sauce gets charred, sticky and caramelized under the broiler. Since this recipe requires so few ingredients, it can be a versatile blank canvas that invites experimentation. Substitute some of the olive oil with toasted sesame oil and top with toasted sesame seeds for a nuttier flavor; replace some of the honey with hot honey; or simply top with lemon zest and juice at the end for the brightest results.",
