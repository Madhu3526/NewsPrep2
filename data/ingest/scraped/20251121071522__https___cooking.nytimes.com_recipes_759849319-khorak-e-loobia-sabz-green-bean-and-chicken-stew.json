  "text": "Lifting spirits with a medley of flavors and vibrant hues worthy of a spring garden, khorak-e loobia sabz is equal parts cozy and comforting, and also perfect for entertaining without much effort. Green beans, loobia sabz in Persian, are the seasonal star of the dish with carrots and potatoes filling it out. This version uses chicken, but you can also use stewing meat, or omit the meat altogether and serve as a vegetarian dish. Saffron, the flag bearer of many Iranian dishes, is added at the end for its distinct perfume, earthy and floral notes, and rich pop of color, but you can also leave it out without the need to substitute with any other spices. Serve khorak-e loobia sabz with rice or bread; salad-e Shirazi and mast-o khiar.",
