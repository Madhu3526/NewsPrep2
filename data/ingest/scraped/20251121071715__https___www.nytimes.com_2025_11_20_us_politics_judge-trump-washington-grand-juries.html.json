  "text": "A federal judge in Washington ruled on Thursday that the Justice Department could prosecute a man in federal court using a city grand jury, finding that the District of Columbia’s unusual legal system allowed prosecutors to use the workaround in many other cases, potentially including ones involving serious crimes like sedition and treason.\n\nThe decision by Chief Judge James E. Boasberg of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia applied immediately only to Kevontae Stewart, a Washington resident who was indicted in the local District of Columbia Superior Court on a weapons charge in September, but only after a federal grand jury rejected a similar charge.\n\nA federal magistrate judge had called that sequence of events “unprecedented” and refused to accept the indictment in federal court since it had been secured in another court. But Judge Boasberg wrote on Thursday that the magistrate had erred — a ruling that could have far-reaching implications in President Trump’s expansive approach to law enforcement in the nation’s capital.\n\nThe decision could potentially allow federal prosecutors to bypass federal grand juries, which are typically reserved for more serious crimes in Washington, at will. It came as federal grand jurors in Washington have repeatedly refused to approve indictments against fellow city residents, amid the president’s aggressive policing surge, a highly unusual pattern.",
