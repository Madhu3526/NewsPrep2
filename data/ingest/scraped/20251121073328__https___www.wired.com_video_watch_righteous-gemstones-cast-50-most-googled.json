Yes.\n\nThey're talking with the son.\n\nOh, yeah. Yep.\n\nSkyler the son. Skyler's.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nThat good looking young fellow.\n\nHe's such a honk, dude.\n\nEveryone thinks he's so honky and I would have to agree.\n\nEveryone's all like, Oh, he's sweet, but he's also cute.\n\nYeah, like, get over yourself how sweet and cute\n\nand also nice he is. Oh!\n\nSo nice. What a prick.\n\nHow much are the Gemstones worth?\n\nOoo, dollar, dollar bills, y'all. Net worth.\n\nOkay.\n\nI don't know if we've ever fully discussed this.\n\nThey're not billionaires.\n\nI don't think they're in the B Club.\n\nYeah, I don't think it's in the B Club,\n\nbut I think it's hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nYeah, it's H. I would agree.\n\nIt's hundreds of millions, yes.\n\nYeah.\n\nGet out of here!\n\nWho sings for Judy Gemstone?\n\nHow dare they? Okay, what the fuck?\n\nHow fucking dare they?\n\nKiss my ass.\n\nEdi sings for Judy Gemstone, of course.\n\nGive 'em some.\n\nHit 'em with it. Hit 'em with it.\n\nI sing for Judy Gemstone.\n\nI go into a studio in Charleston, I record the song\n\nand then I sing it on set.\n\nHit 'em with it.\n\nTable flip! Acapella, hit 'em with it.\n\nOh, hit 'em with it? [Danny laughing]\n\nHit 'em with it. Acapella.\n\nHit 'em with it.\n\n♪ Butterflies. ♪\n\nOh!\n\nThat's all they get!\n\nThat's all you get. How dare you ask that!\n\nThat's all you get.\n\nWhich Culkin is in The Righteous Gemstone?\n\nThat would be McCauley.\n\nMcCauley. McCauley.\n\nDoes McCauley have an Academy Award?\n\nUgh!\n\n♪ Ah ♪\n\nNo, he doesn't.\n\nThat goes to the other one, Kieran, Kieran.\n\nMcCaulay Culkin plays Baby Billy's estranged son.\n\nHarmon. Harmon.\n\nYep, that's right.\n\nYeah, our cousin.\n\nCousin Harmon. Yeah.\n\nHarmon Freeman. Little H.\n\nI guess we don't know if his mom\n\ngave him his father's last name,\n\nbut I think it's Harmon Freeman.\n\nYeah. Yep. Okay.\n\nHow did Keith and Kelvin meet?\n\nHmm. Hmm.\n\nDo you have something cooked up in your nog?\n\nIn my head I had a loose idea.\n\nI thought maybe you, you know, you saved him.\n\nYeah, I'm always cruising satanic cults, going undercover.\n\nI feel like Kelvin goes a little undercover,\n\ngoes in all black with like the tears,\n\nthe black streaks coming down and he's just like,\n\nSo, what's up?\n\nDo you want Christ in your life?\n\nDo you want Jesus to fill your soul?\n\nGot so smirky when he does it.\n\nI was like, Do you want that?\n\nIt worked. It worked on him.\n\nAnd it worked on Keith. It's fantastic.\n\nYeah, it was cool.\n\nWho is The Righteous Gemstones based on?\n\nIt's not one family in particular.\n\nI think it's just they're their own creation.\n\nYou know? Yeah, their own thing.\n\nPart gangster, part minister,\n\nyou know, no one in particular.\n\nI have someone very-\n\nYou base you on somebody.\n\nYeah, but I won't tell. [Adam and Edi laughing]\n\nGoogle that.\n\nYeah, try to Google that.\n\nGet that card outta here!\n\nWho wrote The Righteous Gemstones?\n\nRight here. Two of 'em right here.\n\nHere we go. That's right.\n\nWe did it.\n\nAnd then there was also a writing staff.\n\nThere's John Carcieri and Jeff Fradley\n\nand Kevin Barnett and Chris Pappas.\n\nYep. Yep.\n\nNice little crew.\n\nGet that card outta my face!\n\nWow, I keep getting very salacious Kelvin questions.\n\nWhy does Eli break Kelvin's thumbs?\n\nMy take on that would be because Kelvin's was being a dick.\n\nYeah, he was being a salty little bitch.\n\nYeah, you tried to fight your dad.\n\nYou pushed him down. Yeah, I did.\n\nOh my God.\n\nI feel like my actual father would also break my thumbs\n\nif I did what I did to Eli.\n\nWhy does Judy Gemstone always wear blue?\n\nWhen we shot the pilot,\n\nmy note to the costume designer, Sarah Trost,\n\nwas that each gemstone would be like a Power Ranger.\n\nThat everyone would have their own gemstone color\n\nthat their costume would always be connected to.\n\nGreen. So you were green?\n\nYeah, it was green.\n\nJudy was blue. Blue.\n\nJesse was, like, ruby, you know?\n\nSo that's it.\n\n'Cause they are each a gemstone.\n\nThat's what it is.\n\nBoomyah.\n\nWow. Boom. Boom.\n\nBoom, boomyah! Boomyah!\n\n[all laughing]\n\nI've never heard boomyah before.\n\nIt's new.\n\nThis is why he's the creator, dude.\n\nHe creates these fun words, these worlds to live in.\n\nBoomyah.\n\nHow many kids does Jesse Gemstone have?\n\nBoop, boop, boop. That we know of.\n\nThree. Three.\n\nThat we know of.\n\nYep, that's it.\n\nI think three. Me too.\n\nThere could be a hidden one, right?\n\nBut there's probably three.\n\nThere could be with him.\n\nThree established.\n\nOkay, get this car outta my face!\n\nAnother Kelvin question.\n\nDoes Kelvin Gemstone come out?\n\nYes, he does.\n\nOh, yeah. He does.\n\nOh, this is a good one.\n\nWho killed Scotty in The Righteous Gemstones?\n\nIt was Aunt Tiffany, blew his head off by accident.\n\nOh, that's right. Oh my God.\n\nYep. Mm-hmm.\n\nOof. Classic Aunt Tiff.\n\nAunt Tiff, that dog.\n\nGet that card outta my face.\n\nWhy did baby Billy leave his son?\n\nOkay, I mean, this is layered.\n\nAll right, deep, wow.\n\nBut we could boil this down to, like,\n\nthis is just kind of what that dude's gonna do.\n\n[Danny laughing] Yeah, for sure.\n\nI don't know if there was a particular reason.\n\nI guess you could, in that episode,\n\ntrace it back to, like, I don't know,\n\nhe was not wanting to be with the son's mom anymore.\n\nYeah, I think that he was disappointed in who he is\n\nand I don't think he thought he had what it took\n\nto be a good dad so he got outta there, focus on himself.\n\nI think he was right. Yeah.\n\nYeah, he was right in doing that.\n\nWho shot Eli? Ooo!\n\nIt's interesting that people google this stuff.\n\nYou can watch the show.\n\nThe answers are all in there.\n\nYou don't have to just Google.\n\nThat would be the Cycle Ninjas shot Eli.\n\nThey sure did. That is right.\n\nYeah, hired though by somebody else.\n\nSpoiler alert.\n\nUh-oh.\n\nSpoiler alert, the show's been out, you can watch it.\n\nYeah, that's true. Boomyah.\n\nBoomyah.\n\nWho's your favorite Righteous Gemstone character?\n\nThe hard hitting Qs.\n\nThey're asking Google that, huh?\n\nThey're going through Google,\n\nthey're asking who's your favorite\n\nand Google has the answer. Yeah.\n\nYou know, Keith, I get a kick outta him.\n\nJudy, I think you really make me laugh in your character.\n\nThanks, Adam. So sick.\n\nThat's sick.\n\nBut, Harmon. Oh! Oh!\n\nI think it's Harmon. Yeah.\n\nAre Kelvin and Keefe a couple?\n\nI'd say hard yes.\n\nYeah, dude.\n\nWe're in it to win it now.\n\nWhy is BJ always drinking milk?\n\n[Adam laughing] Ah!\n\nYou know, that was something that was established\n\nin the first season and we just never went away from it.\n\nWe just always had a, a goblet of milk for BJ.\n\nI'm glad someone noticed that, it's the details.\n\nIt's a nice little touch. It is.\n\nEli, he needs that calcium, I think, you know?\n\nYeah, he's a brittle man.\n\nHe's very brittle.\n\nHe's a wisp. A little wisp of a man.\n\nIf you like finding stuff too,\n\nthere's times when BJ will sniff that milk like it's wine.\n\n[Danny laughing]\n\nWhat is the meaning of the season two finale?\n\nThe meaning.\n\nThe meaning. The meaning.\n\nThey smoke the competition.\n\nThey kill people in the end and their love will never die.\n\nYou know? That's the meaning.\n\nLove will never die.\n\nThat's what it should've been called.\n\nWhat is the meaning of the season two finale?\n\nYeah, I don't know.\n\nIt's kind of in there.\n\nYeah. Just watch it.\n\nYeah, just watch it. Oh, what are you doing?\n\nJust get that card out of our face.\n\n[Danny laughing]\n\nWhat are your favorite jokes or lines\n\nfrom The Righteous Gemstones?\n\nYour monologue, what was that, season one or two?\n\nMm-hmm. Season one.\n\nSeason one when you're in that diner.\n\nIn the Outback Steakhouse.\n\nYeah, that was a banger of a monologue.\n\nSo watch the show.\n\nDo you remember that entire monologue?\n\nYou know, chunks. You can do it now.\n\n♪ Butterflies ♪\n\n[all laughing]\n\nThe monologue is just you singing.\n\nAh, get this car outta my face.\n\nOh, you know what?\n\nI met this dude the other day.\n\nHe was like, Oh my God, my friend and I,\n\nwhen we see each other,\n\nhe lived in New York and he was like,\n\nWe don't say, 'Hi,' we go,\n\n'Thank you for meeting me at this neutral location.'\n\n[all laughing]\n\nThey refuse, like, hug.\n\nThey just, like, stand there trying to say that\n\nas seriously as possible.\n\nThat's funny.\n\nWhat year was Judy Gemstone born?\n\nI feel like it's '80. Is that right?\n\nYeah. I'm trying to think of our\n\nflashback episodes.\n\nMaybe '79, '80. Yeah.\n\nYeah, that seems like that's in the zone.\n\n[buzzer buzzing] Yeah.\n\n♪ Butterflies ♪\n\n♪ Butterflies ♪\n\nHow much of The Righteous Gemstones is improv?\n\nI would say 12 to 32%.\n\nSomewhere in there. [Danny laughing]\n\nI'm a math guy, so that's how my brain works.\n\nDoesn't the whole world know that about Adam?\n\nYeah. Yeah, he's a brain guy.\n\nMath guy. I'm a math guy.\n\nOh, he is a math guy. Oh, yeah.\n\nAnd a brain guy.\n\nYeah, well, if you're a math guy, you're also a brain guy.\n\nYeah, of course.\n\nAnd what was the word you made up earlier?\n\nBoomyah. Boomyah.\n\nBoomyah. Boomyah.\n\nYou're brain guy. Boomyah.\n\nWhy did Baby Billy leave Tiffany?\n\nYou're getting the hard hitting questions, dude.\n\nI mean, I think it's important that we remember\n\nthat ultimately he didn't leave Tiffany\n\nand I think, again, this is like Baby Billy's\n\na damaged dude and I think he starts to, like, doubt\n\nthat he could have any effect on the world\n\nand any added value or worth to anything\n\nand sometimes he's just gotta get the fuck out.\n\nHe's a runner.\n\nThey're together now and I think they're together forever.\n\nThey learned.\n\nWhat happened to Baby Billy's son?\n\nHe grew up to be well adjusted.\n\nHe has a couch with cup holders in it, you know,\n\nso he's obviously well adjusted fella.\n\nYeah. That's a nice life.\n\nHe worked. That's a nice life.\n\nWhat are the bugs in The Righteous Gemstones?\n\nOh, they're talking about the locusts.\n\nThe locusts. The locusts.\n\nYes. [bell dinging]\n\nAt first I thought it meant, like,\n\nwhat are the glitches you guys encounter during production?\n\nAny camera mishaps?\n\nWhat did Eli do to Baby Billy?\n\nIn Baby Billy's eyes I think he thinks that he stole\n\nhis, like, stage partner, he stole his act, you know,\n\nand then he aligned himself with her,\n\nbut really he just married Baby Billy's sister\n\nand Baby Billy's a little bitch about that.\n\nYeah, don't be a bitch, Baby Billy.\n\nWhy did Gideon leave the family?\n\nI think he was probably the only sane one\n\nand saw his insane family.\n\nHe's like, I gotta get the fuck outta here.\n\nAnd he was right in doing so and then he came back\n\nand God, I'm happy to have him.\n\nYep.\n\nI mean, we're talking really cute, really sweet.\n\nGod, he's so sweet, so cute.\n\nSkyler, we love him.\n\nGet this card outta my face.\n\nI feel like we had runs in the show\n\nwhere Judy was really going off about how hot Gideon was.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Right?\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nYeah, watching him from across the room\n\ntalking about how fit he was.\n\nAnd also just at the craft service table,\n\nEdi would say stuff like that.\n\nTotally.\n\nYeah, was always mentioning it.\n\nI mean, the thing is, if we're at lunch,\n\nyou know, or we're at craft services\n\nor I see Skyler walking in the bathroom,\n\nit's not gonna be that hard for him\n\nto take his shirt off from me.\n\nIt wouldn't be. It shouldn't be.\n\nYeah, it shouldn't be.\n\nWho's the bad guy in The Righteous Gemstones?\n\nOoo, the bad guy.\n\nGreat question. We've had a few.\n\nMm-hmm, we got a handful of bad guys.\n\nYou know, every season, there is like an adversary or foe\n\nthat is unique to that season,\n\nbut, you know, a lot of times I think\n\nwho gets in The Righteous Gemstones'\n\nway the most are themselves.\n\nWow. Yeah.\n\nBoomyah. Poignant.\n\nBoomyah. Boomyah.\n\nDoes Walton Goggins actually sing\n\nin Righteous Gemstones?\n\nThe answer is yes, of course he does.\n\nWe all do! [Danny laughing]\n\nEdi, Edi, chill.\n\nJesus, you threw that one hard, dude.\n\nI felt Edi's rage.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhy did Kelvin kiss Keefe? Oh!\n\nMmm, 'cause them soft lips.\n\n[Edi laughing]\n\nIn the season three, towards the end, that was, what?\n\nThe second to last episode,\n\nthat wasn't scripted and then-\n\nWell, it was scripted, but it was an alt script.\n\nWe weren't sure if we were gonna bridge that\n\nin the fourth season or if it was gonna be\n\nthe end of the third.\n\nAnd that was like my second,\n\nI think first or second day shooting that season\n\nand I'm like, We're in it.\n\nI'm already kissing my buddy at work.\n\nThis is gonna be a hell of a season.\n\nWho blackmailed Jesse Gemstone?\n\nWho didn't? His own child.\n\nIt's disgusting. It's disgusting.\n\nWhy is Gideon helping Scotty?\n\nI think Gideon is disappointed in his family\n\nand I think he feels a little bit betrayed\n\nby the fact that they don't practice what they preach.\n\nSo I think he sees Scotty as a way to maybe\n\nkind of get some revenge on his family\n\nand is led down a bad path, unfortunately,\n\nand then Aunt Tiffany blows Scotty's brains out.\n\nDo Judy and BJ stay together?\n\nOh, yeah.\n\nI think she would kill him\n\nbefore she allowed him to leave,\n\nso absolutely they're together.\n\nYes.\n\nWho is the mother of Judy Gemstone?\n\nAmy Lee Gemstone,\n\nwho's also the mother of Jesse Gemstone and Kelvin Gemstone.\n\nWhat's up? What's up? What's up? What's up?\n\nAmy Lee. Boomyah. Boomyah.\n\nWho plays young Jesse Gemstone?\n\nWe have some incredible actors\n\nthat play the young versions of us.\n\nGavin plays young Jesse Gemstone. Who plays young Judy?\n\nEmma Shannon and she is awesome.\n\nThose kids were so good though that we didn't\n\neven initially plan on coming back to them every season\n\nand once we saw how well they were able\n\nto channel those characters,\n\nwe had to just keep bringing them back\n\nand writing more for them.\n\nYeah, they're incredible.\n\nSometimes watching Emma, like,\n\nmaybe this is gonna get too real,\n\nsometimes she's so good and so funny,\n\nlike, it brings tears to my eyes.\n\nI'm like,\n\nFuck me, she's, like, really channeling some shit.\n\nYeah, they're the real deal.\n\nHow did Judy and BJ meet?\n\nThis was a thing we talked about as being a possibility\n\nand the few times we even wrote it\n\nand then it just wasn't ever needed to do it.\n\nBut remember we talked about that thing\n\nof I was shoplifting from- Yes, from the grocery store.\n\nYeah. Yep. Yep.\n\nI was shoplifting from the Piggly Wiggly\n\nwhere he worked in the optometry department.\n\nYeah, he's who caught me in love ensued.\n\nWe thought about showing that\n\nand we never did because the first time you meet BJ,\n\nhe has just undergone a plastic surgery.\n\nIt was the beginning of him trying to fit into the family\n\nand he had changed his nose.\n\nSo we always imagined that maybe there'd be a scene\n\nwith you two guys meeting and BJ\n\nhaving a drastically different looking face.\n\n[Adam and Eli laughing]\n\nBut we never got around to it.\n\nHow did Jesse and Amber get back together?\n\nWell, Amber shot Jesse in his asshole\n\nand that kind of basically killed all the bad feelings\n\nbetween each other and then they got back together.\n\nSo, it was in the asshole?\n\nYeah, yeah, it was in the hole.\n\nIt was definitely in the hole.\n\nI thought it might've been in the meat,\n\nbut in it was in the hole.\n\nDid it come out ever? Nope, still there.\n\nWow. Yep, still there.\n\nHe's a big man. Lodged in the hole.\n\nLodged in the hole.\n\nDoes Gideon come back?\n\nYou don't even watch the show.\n\nSometimes it's easier just to Google it, you know?\n\nYeah, I mean, just watch the show.\n\nYeah, he does, he does. He's on the show.\n\nVery talented. Skyler, hot too.\n\nThat's right. Very hot.\n\nWho's the youngest Gemstone?\n\nWell, of the siblings, that's Kelvin Gemstone.\n\nWhat's up? What's up?\n\nIf you're talking the kids of Jesse,\n\nwe're talking, like, third generation,\n\nthat would be young Abraham.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nHow dare they with this next question.\n\nHow dare?\n\nIs BJ Judy's cousin?\n\nWhat?\n\nWhat?\n\nOh, someone dug deep.\n\nYeah. Dang!\n\nYeah, they know the true tea.\n\nYou know what?\n\nThat would've actually been pretty good.\n\nThat could've been what it is.\n\nUh-huh. Kissing cousins. Yep.\n\nBut the answer is no, of course not.\n\nBJ is not Judy's cousin.\n\nNo. No.\n\nJudy would never hook up with cousins.\n\nYeah. No.\n\nShe knows a ton of people who would like to\n\nhook up with their siblings.\n\nYeah. But-\n\nYeah, exactly.\n\nShe knows a ton of people that would?\n\nWow. Yeah, she does.\n\nJudy runs in some good circles.\n\nRun with a cool crew, yeah, yep, yep.\n\nWe did it. We answered all the Googles.\n\nOh, every Google question possible, we answered them.\n\nYep. So thank you Wired.\n\nThank you Wired.\n\nShout out to Skyler. Chill.\n\nTake your shirt off Holmes. Boomyah.\n\n[all laughing] [upbeat music]",
