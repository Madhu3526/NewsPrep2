  "text": "The vote count at the Caerphilly by-election looked like many others. Tables were arranged in the middle of a sports hall, black ballot boxes started to arrive and the counting began.\n\nBut camped out at the hall in this ex-coal mining town, known for its cheese, was a throng of journalists and photographers from London – a rare sight for an election to the Welsh Parliament.\n\nSomething bigger was afoot: that by-election last month was as much about who was going to lose as it was about who was going to win.\n\nThe losers were Labour. They trailed in third place behind Plaid Cymru and Reform UK, winning just 11% of the vote. It marked Labour's first major electoral defeat in Caerphilly for 100 years.\n\nIf a similar result is replicated across the whole of Wales at the Senedd election next May - which will switch to a new proportional representation voting system - then the party could face an existential threat.",
