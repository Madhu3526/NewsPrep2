  "text": "is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2006, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThe Halo 3 soundtrack could soon be joining classics like “Jingle Bell Rock” and “Deck the Halls” on your holiday playlist, if you deck your halls with Hallmark’s new Xbox 360 Keepsake ornament. It’s now available from Hallmark’s online store and Amazon for $28.99 and pressing its power button plays the console’s swooshy startup sound and then about 20 seconds of the Behold a Pale Horse track from the Halo 3 soundtrack that incorporates elements of the Halo theme, according to IGN.\n\nThe 3.25-inch tall replica of Microsoft’s nearly 20-year-old console (the 360 launched in November 2005) is surprisingly detailed for something that’s going to get lost amongst a sea of ornaments on your tree, and includes a matching mini controller permanently leaning up against the console’s base.\n\nAlthough the Xbox 360 could be used laying on its side, Hallmark’s ornament features it in a standing orientation. Image: Hallmark\n\nIt’s powered by a trio of replaceable button batteries should you get overly nostalgic and hit the button ad nauseam. The Xbox 360’s power button even lights up green when pressed, and although green and red is often considered the official colors of the holiday season, it doesn’t appear as if you can create the 360’s Red Ring of Death, despite Microsoft not shying away from making other merchandise featuring the infamous error message.",
