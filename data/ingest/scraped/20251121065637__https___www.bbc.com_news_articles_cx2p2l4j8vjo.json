All 267 passengers and crew on board the Queen Jenuvia 2 were rescued after it became stuck near the uninhabited island of Jogdo, off the coast of Jangsan Island in Shinan County, on Wednesday. Twenty-seven people sustained minor injuries from the impact of grounding. The coast guard told the BBC they had arrested the helmsman and the first mate for gross negligence resulting in injuries. The helmsman initially blamed a steering wheel malfunction, but later admitted he had been on his phone and missed the point at which he was supposed to change course.",
