  "text": "The Wireless Power Consortium (WPC) released the latest version of the Qi2 standard in April 2025 , bringing wireless chargers a step closer to the faster charging rates offered by USB cables. Qi2.2 supports up to 25W charging , which is a welcome improvement to the 15W that has been the maximum rate for the standard since Qi1.2 was released in October 2015.\n\nThe new Qi2.2 standard also carries forward the use of magnets to help devices and chargers line up perfectly for optimal charging. First introduced with the iPhone 12 as MagSafe, Apple helped bring the feature’s functionality to the Qi2 standard by practically giving away the tech’s design. It’s since been standard on iPhones, but more Android devices are adding support for Qi2, including those from Google. The Pixel 10 family includes a MagSafe-compatible alternative called PixelSnap, and the Pixel 10 Pro XL supports the faster Qi2.2 25W charging.",
