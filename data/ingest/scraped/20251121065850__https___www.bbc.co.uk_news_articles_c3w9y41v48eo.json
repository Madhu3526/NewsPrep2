  "text": "Natalie Jones, from Cardiff, has endometriosis and adenomyosis, external, and is currently waiting for her fourth surgery.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who was diagnosed in 2018, has recently started to date again after a period of ill-health.\n\nThe PhD student described herself as naturally a \"spontaneous person\" but said often she is so exhausted she fears cancelling dates may give the wrong impression - that she's unreliable or worse, uninterested.\n\n\"If you're just exhausted sometimes and you have to cancel plans especially in a new relationship, that might sound like you're just putting somebody off, or you're unreliable or you're messing someone around.\"\n\nThe academic researcher said it can be particularly complicated when it comes to sex with the extra worry of heavy bleeding or pain.\n\n\"You don't want to set that expectation that intimacy is going to happen by having that discussion too early on but then if one thing leads to another, when do you bring it up, do you stop midway and say, 'oh by the way',\" she said.\n\nThe keen traveller and gym-goer said that while it can be difficult watching friends start to settle down, she doesn't let it affect her.\n\n\"This is something that I can't control, but that doesn't take away from who I am and so if I'm dating or speaking with somebody who isn't prepared to either learn or understand... then that's probably not the right person anyway,\" she added.",
