  "text": "I've been making almost this exact recipe for years, and it's definitely a last minute what to cook favourite. Definitely use tuna in oil for more flavour... drain the oil into a large fry pan and use it to slowly saute the garlic and pepper flakes. I add a couple of tablespoons of crushed baby capers . Add the drained pasta to the fry pan, not the contents of the fry pan to the drained pasta to make sure I don't miss out on any flavour. Finally, you can't add too much arugula. Twice as much as the recipe here says. it wilts to nothing. And I finish with a squeeze of lemon juice before serving.\n\nIs this helpful? 200",
