  "text": "Wonderful! I made this as written except I used two sheet pans (how is everyone fitting everything on one sheet pan???) and didn’t have time to do the pickled onion. Totally agree that the dish needs some brightness and tang from the recommended pickled onion BUT may I recommend as an alternative, serving some of Sheela Prakash’s “caramelized carrot and halloumi salad” with it? I made that dish the night before and the two dishes complement each other beautifully. The vinegary kale adds just the right hit of brightness and acidity, and the carrots and halloumi are a marvelous addition.\n\nIs this helpful?",
