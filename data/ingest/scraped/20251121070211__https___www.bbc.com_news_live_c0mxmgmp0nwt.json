  "text": "What we heard about Ukraine, Mamdani and Trump's 'sedition' comments\n\nSakshi Venkatraman\n\nReporting from New York\n\nWe heard earlier from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on several of the major news items of the day.\n\nHere's a wrap of the key topics she addressed:\n\nOn Ukraine:\n\nLeavitt didn't provide specific details about a US-backed deal to end the war in Ukraine.\n\n\"It's a good plan for both Russia and Ukraine,\" she said. \"We believe that it should be acceptable to both sides.\"\n\nShe rebuffed questions about other reports which indicate the deal would have Ukraine give up large swaths of territory to Russia and cut down its military.\n\nOn Zohran Mamdani:\n\nLooking ahead to the New York City mayor-elect's visit to the White House tomorrow, Leavitt doubled down on language Trump has used many times.\n\n\"Tomorrow, we have a communist coming to the White House,\" she said.\n\nMamdani is a self-described democratic socialist, not a communist, but this could foreshadow an icy reception tomorrow.\n\nOn Trump's sedition and death penalty comment:\n\nLeavitt said firmly that the president does not want to execute Democratic lawmakers.\n\nIt's a topic that caused a storm today after Trump wrote on social media this morning, \"SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH\" in reference to a video released by Democratic lawmakers.\n\nLeavitt says the criticism should be directed at the lawmakers, who in their video encouraged service members to defend the constitution and defy unlawful orders that may pit the military against American citizens.\n\n\"It perhaps is punishable by law,\" Leavitt said of the video's message.\n\nWe're ending our live coverage soon, but you can read our recap of today's developments in Ukraine here.",
