  "text": "Known as 'the trip chocolate', Kvikk Lunsj has fuelled outdoor adventures for generations. So, what makes this chocolate so controversial?\n\nIt's started to drizzle across the marsh, but we're prepared – as we Norwegians say, \"there's no bad weather, only bad clothing\". We've just happened upon a patch of cloudberries, an elusive Arctic delicacy that thrives in wet bogs, noting their location so we can come back to pick them when they've ripened to orange. And as we huddle under the soft needles of a spruce tree, my friend digs into her pocket and pulls out something no Norwegian would ever leave behind on a trip into nature: a Kvikk Lunsj.\n\nKvikk Lunsj is a four-fingered chocolate bar that's beloved across Norway and synonymous with outdoor exploration. The snack's slogan is \"tursjokoladen\" (\"the trip chocolate\"), and ads for the wafers often depict hikers spinning a compass, skiers summiting frosty peaks and people drinking water from rushing rivers. Today, roughly 60 million Kvikk Lunsj bars are produced each year – about 11 for every Norwegian – and whether you're skipping across mountain brooks or striking out in a kayak, no journey into the Norwegian wilderness is complete without one. That's because Kvikk Lunsj isn't just a sweet treat; it's part of our national heritage.\n\nKvikk Lunsj was invented in 1937, but according to its creator Johan Throne Holst, the story actually starts 45 years earlier with a failed hike. Throne Holst, then a young businessman, wanted to show Norway's stunning landscapes to his German business associate, but they lost their way in the woods outside Oslo. As the pair trudged on, directionless and increasingly hungry, the German complained that their journey would have been salvaged had they packed some chocolate.",
