  "text": "To take the sting out of onions or shallots, after slicing, dicing, mincing, etc., try a) soaking them in ice water for 10 min before adding to the salad, or b) mix them with the lemon juice, vinegar, (or any acid) etc. called for in the recipe for at least 10 min before adding other dressing ingredients so that they can pickle. I usually do this step at the beginning of my prep work and by the time I have prepared the other ingredients for my salad, the onions or shallots are nicely mellowed.\n\nIs this helpful? 44",
