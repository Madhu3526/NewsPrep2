  "text": "On Nov. 28, 1925, Uncle Jimmy Thompson, a crusty, 77-year-old hard-drinking musician, played an informal program of fiddle tunes broadcast by the newly established Nashville radio station WSM. His spirited performance generated a torrent of fan mail and phone calls, prompting WSM’s owners, the National Life and Accident Insurance company, to assemble a regular lineup of musical entertainment that became the Grand Ole Opry. Over the next 100 years, the weekly broadcast — the longest-running radio show in the United States — would go from being a humble hoedown to the driving force behind Nashville’s emergence as the Country Music Capital of the World.\n\nRoy Acuff, Minnie Pearl, Hank Williams, Dolly Parton, Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood are or have been members of the show’s cast, a who’s who of country music royalty that has also made room for a profusion of guests, including the far-flung likes of Richard Nixon and James Brown.\n\nAs much a place as a show, the Opry was first broadcast from WSM’S Studio A on the fifth floor of the National Life building in Nashville before moving to a series of other nearby locations. Foremost among these was a 31-year residency at Ryman Auditorium, the “Mother Church of Country Music,” before the show settled into its current home at the Grand Ole Opry House at suburban Opryland.\n\nThe Opry has endured challenges and setbacks, from the Great Depression and the Nashville flood of 2010 to the changing faces of its audience and cast, and yet somehow managed to survive, much like the family it prides itself on being. What follows are snapshots from each of the show’s 10 decades, with a playlist to match.",
