  "title": "Slow Cooker Gochujang Chicken and Tomatoes Recipe",
  "text": "I made this in a slow cooker today as described in the recipe. Used 3T of gochujang, because we like it, and 2 pints of cherry tomatoes. It was very easy and (we found it to be) tasty. I will make it again when I need something waiting for us in the evening. Served with udon noodles and garnished with scallions and sliced fresh jalapeños.\n\nIs this helpful? 87",
