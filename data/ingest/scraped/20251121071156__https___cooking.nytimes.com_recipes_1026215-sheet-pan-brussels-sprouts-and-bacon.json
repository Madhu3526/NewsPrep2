  "title": "Sheet-Pan Brussels Sprouts and Bacon Recipe",
  "text": "Brussels sprouts and bacon are proof that opposite flavors can attract. In this easy sheet-pan recipe, the earthy, green sprouts are roasted with rich and smoky bacon so their flavors mingle while they cook. The bacon’s robust flavor seeps into the sprouts’ leaves, helping them caramelize and adding textural contrast to each bite. Shallots are roasted alongside too, adding sweetness as they brown. A little garlic, lemon, some red pepper and perhaps an herb add brightness and spark to this simple side.",
