  "text": "Why World Cup qualification is about more than football\n\nJames Cook\n\nScotland editor\n\nFootball has shaped Scotland’s cultural identity.\n\nOnce a weekly escape from the shipyards and the mines, the game still has the capacity to unite and to surprise in the era of the smartphone and the games console.\n\nThe last time Scotland partied like this - the last time the men's national side played in a World Cup - Bill Clinton was in the White House, Google didn't exist and there was no Scottish Parliament.\n\nNow, for the first time in the 21st Century, Scotland's men are heading to the World Cup finals.\n\nThe veteran commentator and author, Archie MacPherson, told me the result was about more than football.\n\n\"Every now and then, a country has to look at its culture and see how do you value sport? How important is sport in all the ingredients that make up a nation?\n\n\"I think last night we saw it in the reaction of the supporters.\n\n\"So that's the effect it'll have. There'll be a boost to morale in a kind of a way.\n\n\"Some people might say: 'Oh come on, it's only a football match.' Tell that to a football supporter!\"",
