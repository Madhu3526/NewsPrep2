The milestone was reached on board the 132nd Falcon 9 launch of 2025, tying the previous annual launch record with more than two full months to go in the year.\n\nOf those 10k satellites, only about 8,608 are currently operational, according to Jonathan McDowell’s satellite tracker calculations. Starlink satellites have a lifespan of roughly five years before they’re intentionally de-orbited to burn up in the atmosphere. The first Starlink prototypes launched in February 2018 ahead of its 2021 commercial service offering.\n\nSpaceX has approval to launch 12,000 satellites — with over 30,000 planned — to bring fast, low-latency internet to the world. Others like Amazon’s Project Kuiper and efforts in Europe and China, have their own mega constellation plans, raising concerns about the threat caused by overcrowding.",
