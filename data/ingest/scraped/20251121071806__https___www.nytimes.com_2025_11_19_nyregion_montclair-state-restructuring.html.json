  "text": "It began, the professors said, last November, when the provost held up a yellow legal pad at a college meeting.\n\n“If we were to restructure, how should we do it?” the provost, Junius Gonzales, asked the assorted faculty members of the College of the Humanities and Social Sciences at Montclair State University, New Jersey’s second-largest public university.\n\nA year later, the answer is becoming clearer, in a way that many of the professors fear will mean the end of humanities at the school as they know it.\n\nLast week, university administrators sent faculty members a restructuring plan for the college, which teaches about 5,000 students in subjects from English to psychology. The college’s 15 academic departments will be merged into thematic-based schools, with broad names meant to signal their relevance. Within those schools, the individual academic departments will probably be abolished — or at least, will no longer exist in the same way.",
