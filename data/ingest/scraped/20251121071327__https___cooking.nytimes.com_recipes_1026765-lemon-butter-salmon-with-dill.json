  "text": "Really enjoyed this. Served over brown rice and it was the perfect light, mid-week meal but totally filling. Can't wait to try the leftovers tomorrow! Only had about 1 T rice vinegar and filled in the last 2 T with sherry vinegar for the cucumber: worked out very well. Next time I think I will let the honey butter mixture (for salmon) cool a while, maybe the whole hour or longer, so that I can smear it on the salmon instead of it running off immediately.\n\nIs this helpful?",
