  "title": "We Knew The Racism Against Zohran Mamdani Would Get Weird — And Here We Are",
  "text": "Any Muslim American who runs for public office knows one thing immediately: the scrutiny will be ugly, and it will come to fruition quickly. Islamophobia is never subtle. And the moment Democratic nominee for New York City mayor Zohran Mamdani stepped into the spotlight, I knew he would be a target for some pretty traditional racism — and some weird stuff none of us could’ve seen coming.\n\nOne recent post on X perfectly captures the sheer absurdity of the Islamophobia he navigates on a daily basis. It started when an X user posted a photo of bacon frying with the caption, “Just wanting to share some bacon with all of my loveable [sic] Muslim peeps this morning. It’s the least I can do.” Another user then decided to rope Mamdani in, quoting the post with, “Hey @ZohranMamdani, this is for you, Bone-Petite! [again, sic].” This clownish post was only further punctuated by bad spelling.\n\nMamdani gets plenty of hate — from bigoted conservatives who despise him for being Muslim and from within the Democratic Party, where his socialist politics have made him an easy target. So he doesn’t respond to everything. But this particular exchange clearly stood out to him, probably for the same reason it stopped the rest of us. It was unbelievably stupid.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInstead of responding with outrage (which no one would have faulted him for), he clapped back with a deadpan line, “My brother, this isn’t garlic and we’re not vampires.” Smart, pithy, perfect.\n\nmy brother, this isn’t garlic and we’re not vampires pic.twitter.com/h32OGMb8aq — Zohran Kwame Mamdani (@ZohranKMamdani) September 1, 2025\n\nWhen you’re an American public figure who happens to be Muslim, your religion — and the “otherness” assigned to it — becomes your entire identity. And in the Western imagination, that religion is automatically framed as a threat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo that guy who posted bacon, by the way: If you’re going to come for this man, you’ll surely get lost in a sea of even more basic bigots.\n\nThose of us who believe Mamdani to be a progressive, feminist, anti-racist, equality-seeking candidate have long anticipated the Islamophobic messaging that argues that he’s quite the opposite. We knew some of it would be old-fashioned and other times, it’d be surprising and cloaked in patriotism.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately, it’s weirder and dumber than we expected. And the fact that Mamdani is young and charismatic appears to be melting the brain cells of everyone who hates him. The reality is, he is everything America advertises itself to be — and that’s hard for some people to acknowledge.\n\nBeing Muslim in America while trying to better your community, in some cases, means having to jump through fire (potentially started by bacon grease) to get there. And while Mamdani may take the racist attacks in stride, it doesn’t mean that witnessing this constant barragement doesn’t affect him — and all of us who share his religious identity.\n\nAnd that’s the real danger of what’s coming. The Islamophobia Mamdani faces won’t always be dumb and funny. It will sometimes be designed to derail him. It will exhaust all of us. And whether you align with Mamdani’s politics or not, it’s important to pay attention to — and resist — this age-old tactic of using racism to distract us from moving forward, making progress and bettering our communities.",
