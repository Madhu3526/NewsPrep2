  "text": "Since then, more information has come to light. Trustees at Miss Hall’s hired a law firm last year to conduct an independent investigation of misconduct at the school. The result was the 60-page report released in August. The investigators concluded that Mr. Rutledge had abused at least five students over 20 years and that school leaders had repeatedly failed to investigate third-party reports of his misconduct.\n\nAccording to the report, Mr. Rutledge’s offenses against his students included “grooming behavior, sexual advances, sexual touching, and forcible oral and vaginal intercourse,” as well as other forms of sexual conduct. Ms. Fares has said Mr. Rutledge first had sex with her under a table in his classroom, and later on a yoga mat laid out on the floor of his classroom closet — abuse that continued for years.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Berkshire district attorney said on Monday that the investigation of Mr. Rutledge had remained open and active since the initial decision not to charge him. After the release of the law firm’s report, she said, the office assigned a team to review the findings, which were based on nearly 150 interviews.\n\nThe report also substantiated claims of abuse carried out by seven other former employees at the school, spanning decades. And it included accounts of behavior that might fit the legal definition of rape, regardless of age. One student said that when she had stayed at Mr. Rutledge’s house, she had awakened to him having sex with her.",
