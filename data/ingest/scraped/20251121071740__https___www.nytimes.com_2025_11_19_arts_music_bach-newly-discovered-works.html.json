  "text": "“He never spoke about this until earlier this year,” Koopman said. “He said, ‘You know I think I found two pieces by Bach. Would you be willing to perform them the first time?’ When I played them through, I said — he is completely right.”\n\nWollny said he began thinking he had stumbled across early works by Bach because of similarities in the distinctive style and construction found in the pieces. But the manuscripts had no identifying marks — no signatures, no initials, no dates — and were written in an unfamiliar hand. If these pieces were by Bach, they had been copied. So he set out to determine who had written the manuscripts.\n\nA critical clue came when a fellow researcher, Bernd Koska, found a letter in a Thuringian church archive written in 1729 from an organist named Salomon Günther John, who claimed to have studied under Bach in Arnstadt. The handwriting was familiar, and he alerted Wollny to the discovery.\n\nWollny began searching for more documents written by John, which he said provided a more definitive match to the handwriting of the unsigned manuscripts. He concluded that John had indeed made the copies, in 1705. The combination of the musical clues, and tracing the handwriting to a musician who had studied with Bach, led him to conclude they were genuine.\n\nIt was, he said recently, a very long journey. Wollny said that after he returned from the Brussels library, he had stored the copies of the documents in a desk. He never forgot about them.\n\n“I wanted to find out, what are these pieces?” he said. “Who wrote them? Where did the manuscripts come from? It kept me busy — for more than 30 years.”",
