  "text": "From Ottoman \"cat sitters\" to modern-day street guardians, Istanbul's bond with its cats runs centuries deep.\n\nIn Istanbul, a delicate balance is struck daily in its winding streets, mosques, metro stations and cafés.\n\nMore than 15 million people compete for space in Turkey's largest city, which straddles Europe and Asia on either side of the Bosphorus, much like a house cat perched half on the sofa, half on the coffee table. That's the appropriate visual, because there are an estimated quarter of a million stray kitties living here, too. Cats are woven into the very fabric and history of the city, as ubiquitous as the rugs for sale on every corner. This is a city shared; a city that purrs incessantly with love and life.\n\n\"Istanbul cats are, on the whole, neither pets nor strays, but a hybrid of those terms,\" says Marcel Heijnen, photographer and author of City Cats of Istanbul, adding that the cats are not owned by specific people \"but taken care of by the community in their respective neighbourhoods\".\n\nHe notes a local reverence for cats that he has not witnessed elsewhere. \"Each municipality has a veterinary department that helps street animals in their district, with free neutering service for street cats,\" explains Fatih Dağlı, co-founder of Cat Museum Istanbul. \"Private animal clinics also offer discounted services for street cats, and residents often chip in to pay the vet bills.\"",
