  "text": "Thanksgiving is the best possible time to learn a new card game.\n\nGrab a deck; scrap the jokers. Pick a card — don’t look! — and stick it on your forehead. Pick a category (domestic beers, rom-coms, Thanksgiving sides). Everyone else must get you to guess the card rank by naming an item in that category that think matches how you would rate it: A two means you hate it, an eight is somewhere in the middle, an ace means you’re obsessed with it, so on. Once everyone gives it a shot, you guess the card. If you get it right, everyone else has to drink, and if you’re wrong, bottoms up.\n\nI’m with you You lost me",
