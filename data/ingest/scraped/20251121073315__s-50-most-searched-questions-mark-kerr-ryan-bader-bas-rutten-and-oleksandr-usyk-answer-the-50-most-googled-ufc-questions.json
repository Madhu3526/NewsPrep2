[group laughing]\n\nBut these guys know what's going on,\n\nbecause, I just fan.\n\n[group laughing]\n\nHow does the UFC give nicknames to fighters?\n\nYou kind of pick your own,\n\nor have people, whatever you want.\n\n[bell dinging] Yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nA lot of it is, my name was given to me\n\nby a Brazilian reporter who watched the fights.\n\nAnd he named it, in Portuguese, Maquina de Bater,\n\nthe machine that smashes.\n\nAnd Bader, Vader.\n\nWell, I have Darth 'cause Bader.\n\nYeah. Like Vader.\n\nAnd my alternative was Master,\n\nand Master Bader was not,\n\n[group laughing]\n\nThe cat. The cat,\n\nyeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nBecause when I was young I played football,\n\nI stayed the goalkeeper,\n\nand like my man put a toom!\n\nWent like that.\n\nOh, he's like a cat. Like a cat.\n\nOkay, okay, okay.\n\nI like it.\n\nBut the second my name in a mustache is Usyk.\n\n[Bader] Oh, yeah.\n\nIt's Ukrainian, Usyk, Usyk, this mustache.\n\nOh. Oh, okay.\n\nOkay. Okay.\n\nI see it, too.\n\nSo, you're The Mustache. [group laughing]\n\nCat like mustache.\n\nThe cat like mustache.\n\nWhat is the Octagon's official diameter?\n\nIs it 26?\n\nNo, 33 I believe, 33 or 34.\n\n[alarm buzzing]\n\n33. It depends where it is.\n\nI believe so, yeah.\n\nAll right,\n\nWho won the very first UFC tournament in 1993?\n\nOh, god, Royce Gracie.\n\nRoyce Gracie. Duh.\n\nThat's an easy answer. Oh yeah.\n\nHow does UFC determine pound for pound?\n\nOoh. Well, that's you guys.\n\nYeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nI think it's, it's a...\n\nI believe now it's media that they picked\n\nto do the rankings.\n\n[bell chiming]\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nAh, we're nailing these, man.\n\nThis is knocking it out of the park.\n\n[Bas] So happy.\n\nHow does UFC scoring work?\n\nDomination.\n\nOctagon control. Octagon control.\n\nAggression. Aggression,\n\neffective striking. Effective striking.\n\nYou're gonna have a winner\n\npretty much every round, correct?\n\nYeah. And if that's a 10-9,\n\nmaybe go in there and knock a guy down a couple of times,\n\nthat'll be a 10-8.\n\nAnd the totals after the three to five rounds,\n\nthey add those up,\n\nand it could be a 30-27 winner, unanimous.\n\nYeah. Split decision.\n\nA couple of different ways.\n\nLooks have nothing to do with it.\n\nDo UFC fighters wear cups?\n\nFuck yeah. [bell dinging]\n\nAbsolutely. [Oleksander and Mark laugh]\n\nIt's very important, it's very important.\n\nYou know when the referee walks over to you\n\nand then he taps with the back of his hand,\n\nthe back of his hand. Not for fun.\n\nHe taps on it, that's the cup check.\n\nSo real quick, this is Gary Goodridge fighting down\n\nin Brazil. Oh my God, I know.\n\nHe got his cup broken in half, plastic cup.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd once I saw that, I'm like, Oh, that's not good.\n\nAnd, talking about cups,\n\nI just want to throw it out there,\n\nGary Goodridge, again, he's in the fighting in Brazil.\n\nThat's Vale Tudo, no rules.\n\nYeah. You know what he did?\n\nHe went with his hand in the cup of the guy\n\nsqueezed his pelotas.\n\nYes.
