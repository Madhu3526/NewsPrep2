Don’t touch it!’ ‘We were the first to hit it!’ ‘We did it! That was us!’”\n\nMr. Fedorov said that the game was constantly expanding to match new technology in the war. Units can now earn points for using robotic ground vehicles on logistics missions like rescuing injured soldiers, for detecting Russian equipment with reconnaissance drones and for destroying targets using guidance systems with artificial intelligence.\n\nThere are still kinks — the system is new, after all. Some unit commanders have said that the new drones did not arrive quickly enough, and some soldiers have complained that they destroyed valuable Russian equipment that was not worth any points.",
