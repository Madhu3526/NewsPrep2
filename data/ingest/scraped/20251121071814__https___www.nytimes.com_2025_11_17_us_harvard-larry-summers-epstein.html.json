  "text": "Larry Summers, Harvard’s former president and a former Treasury secretary, said Monday that he would be stepping back from public commitments following the release of emails between him and Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender.\n\n“I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognize the pain they have caused,” Mr. Summers said in a statement Monday. “I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr. Epstein.”\n\nMr. Summers added that he would continue teaching as an economics professor at Harvard, though he did not specify which public commitments he would be stepping back from.\n\nThe Yale Budget Lab said Mr. Summers has indicated he would be withdrawing from his role in its advisory group. The Hamilton Project, an economics policy arm of the Brookings Institution, said the same. A spokeswoman for the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank, said Mr. Summers would be ending his fellowship there immediately. The Center for Global Development, another think tank, said Mr. Summers was stepping down as board chair.",
