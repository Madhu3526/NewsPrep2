  "text": "I was a litigator for 21 years, and it’s safe to say that I never witnessed the level of legal incompetence that we are witnessing from the Trump administration.\n\nConsider two stories, both from this week alone. First, on Monday, William Fitzpatrick, a federal magistrate judge who is assisting Michael Nachmanoff, the federal judge presiding over the administration’s prosecution of James Comey, the former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, released an opinion about a series of staggering procedural irregularities that originated with Lindsey Halligan, Trump’s handpicked prosecutor in the case.\n\nThe magistrate didn’t recommend dismissing the case (at least not yet), but he did take the highly unusual step of ordering the administration to release otherwise-confidential information about the grand jury proceedings, a move that could very well lay the foundation for dismissal.\n\nThe judge found that the prosecutors had mishandled attorney-client communications between Comey and one of his former lawyers, Daniel Richman, who is a law professor at Columbia Law School and a personal friend of Comey’s.",
