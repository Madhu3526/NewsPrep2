  "text": "“This is a straightforward product that performs better than expected. The setup process took less than one minute. I use it to control my window AC unit, allowing me to start it with a simple voice command from bed. The connection is strong and stays active, even when the Wi-Fi briefly dips. My one minor complaint is that the small status light is very bright at night, so I covered it with a piece of tape. For ease of use and solid function, this plug is highly recommended.” — Brian\n\n“After wasting hours troubleshooting my cheap Tantan smart plugs (especially after my ISP merged my 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks), I finally gave up and bought these Amazon plugs. Best decision ever!\n\nSetup was incredibly simple: 2 minutes and done. No fighting with third-party apps, no separate Alexa linking, no network connectivity issues. The Amazon Alexa app handles everything seamlessly.\n\nThe difference is night and day: While my old plugs constantly struggled with network detection after Xfinity merged my wifi bands, these Amazon plugs handle the 2.4GHz connection flawlessly. No more dealing with Tuya Smart app headaches or wondering why my devices won’t stay connected.\n\nWorth every penny: Yes, they cost a few dollars more than generic brands, but my time has value. When it comes to smart home tech, I’d rather pay a bit extra for something that actually works reliably than deal with constant troubleshooting.\n\nBottom line: If you want smart plugs that work out of the box without the frustration, get these. Your sanity will thank you.” — Brandon Goldsmith\n\n“I wish I got this sooner!! We’ve all been there…the morning rush….getting yourself ready, getting the kids out the door and the dog out…then suddenly you’re at work, 30+ minutes away and panic - did I turn off my straightener?!? I’ve called in neighbors to check for me, but now I don’t have to! Total game changer. When I first got this, if I had that concern, I would hop onto my Alexa app and check to see if the plug was on and if it was, with a click, I turned it off and didn’t have to worry. I soon realized I can just set a timer to turn the plug off, daily, at the time I leave my house.” — Paula",
