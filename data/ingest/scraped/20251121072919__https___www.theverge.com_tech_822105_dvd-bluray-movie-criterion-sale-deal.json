The sale, which will last until December 7th, includes, according to the site, “contemporary and classic films from around the world, including cult favorites, psychological dramas, coming-of-age comedies and more from some of the most celebrated directors.” Not to be left behind, Amazon is also offering half off its selection of Criterion DVDs as well.\n\nThe sale takes in hundreds of the Criterion Collection’s over 1,600 films. The latest additions, most from the 1980s, include Altered States, which has all the weirdness that you can expect from a Ken Russell film; The Breakfast Club, beloved by anyone who was an adolescent in the 1980s, and Rob Reiner’s hilarious rock-bio satire This Is Spinal Tap. These, and a vast array of well-known and obscure-but-worthy films dating from the silent era to present day, are now available at half-price.\n\nWhat with the holidays coming up, this is the perfect time to pick up a DVD or two for friends, family, or yourself.\n\nVerge Deals Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.
