We're ready.\n\nFirst question.\n\nWhen did F1 first start?\n\n1950, at Silverstone. 1950.\n\nIt was called the Grand Prix de Europe,\n\nbecause, I don't know, the FIA was French\n\nI think at the time.\n\nAh, yeah, true.\n\nThere were the FIA back then?\n\nOkay.\n\nWhy do F1 drivers train their neck?\n\nBecause we are strapped down\n\nwith our whole body except the neck.\n\nSo our head is the only thing that can really move.\n\nHonestly, nothing beats just driving.\n\nI don't train the neck.\n\nYou don't do it at all, do you?\n\nWhat, off season?\n\nNever.\n\nThen how do you do the first test?\n\nI arrive to a first test.\n\nI die one day and.\n\nThen you're fine.\n\nReally?\n\nIt's the endurance which is hard to reproduce, basically.\n\nSo, we can get the strength in the gym,\n\nbut you can't hold, you know, your neck for an hour.\n\nDo some F1 tracks have more physical impact\n\non you than others?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nYes.\n\nWell, the most one, Singapore,\n\nI think we agree, Singapore is.\n\nYeah. Qatar.\n\nQatar 23.\n\nThere's two tracks.\n\nQatar and Singapore.\n\nI think the sun board is underrated.\n\nHow much time is an F1 race?\n\nThat's such an easy question.\n\nIt's one hour 40.\n\nBut depends on which race.\n\nExactly.\n\nOkay, Monaco is 1 50.\n\nFour days long, the race.\n\nWhy do I find drivers drive zig-zag?\n\nTo heat. To warm up the tires.\n\nThe tires up.\n\nDrive zig-zig.\n\n[driver laughs]\n\nPutting energy on your tires, turning right.\n\nYou can imagine in a straight line\n\nyou don't got any energy on the sides of the tires.\n\nSo when you do zig-zags, you're loading,\n\nyou're, you're, you're,\n\nyou're stretching the sides of the tires.\n\nWhy does a tire have more grip, Alex?\n\nWhen it's warm.\n\nAnd they're round and they're smooth.\n\n'Cause they are not smooth.\n\nAre F1 cars manual?\n\nKind of.\n\nYou respond to this.\n\nFor sure they're not automatic in terms of,\n\nwe need to drive them.\n\nWe don't clutch or anything to shift.\n\nIt's like your tiptronic car\n\nthat you can put in sport mode.\n\nWe are drivers.\n\nWe are Formula 1 drivers.\n\nThere's no H pattern there.\n\nClutch for first gear and then all up full throttle.\n\nCan F1 cars reverse?\n\nYes they can.\n\nIt's a bit more difficult than my Alfa Romeo road car.\n\nYes.\n\nYou can't see, that's the problem.\n\nThere's no reversing camera.\n\nThe mirrors are very hard to see as well.\n\nSee the problem is when you need to use reverse,\n\nyou're in panic mode because that means you've.\n\nDone something wrong. Done something wrong.\n\nSo you always are like trying to find reverse.\n\nAnd it's a simple way of finding reverse,\n\nbut it takes five, five seconds to find it more or less.\n\nBut it's precious time.\n\nWhy do F1 cars have the halo?\n\nTo protect our heads. The head.\n\nLooks like a flip flop.\n\nYeah. Yes.\n\nIt protects from car going,\n\nit can happen, a car.\n\nIt can happen.\n\nIt has happened.\n\nYeah, it has happened.\n\nA car going into your head like on your side\n\nand it's very, very resistant.\n\nI don't like this question.\n\nNo, you go read it, what is it?\n\nWhy is F1 better than NASCAR?\n\nI mean, no offense.\n\nI like NASCAR a lot. Me too.\n\nMe too.\n\nWe didn't say that.\n\nThat's, that's what you put in our mouths.\n\nYeah, I, I think it's just different.\n\nWe can't take as many curbs as NASCAR.\n\nI would love to take like the last chicane in Canada.\n\nImagine if we're in NASCAR.\n\nWell you make it a straight line.\n\nYeah.\n\nMy only reason why I would say F1 is better than NASCAR\n\nis because it's way faster.\n\nAnd faster, for me, the better.\n\nBut I respect NASCAR drivers and what they do\n\nand I think it's a great motor sport to watch also.\n\nCan F1 drivers see behind them?\n\nYes, we can.\n\nWe have two very small mirrors.\n\nThat vibrate a lot.\n\nThat vibrates a lot\n\nAnd it's vibrates so much that you see sometimes\n\nfive cars in the same spot.\n\nBut it's the same car.\n\nIt's the same car just doing this.\n\nWho is the Formula 1 movie about?\n\nRetired Formula 1 driver, Sonny Hayes,\n\ncomes back to an American team.\n\nBut he was never in F1.\n\nYeah, he was in F1. He was, he was, he was.\n\nIn the beginning.\n\nHad a big crash, yeah.\n\nHe had a massive shunt.\n\nOkay, spoiler.\n\nSo he comes back to Formula 1\n\nto help American team Apex GP\n\nto get to be successful in Formula 1.\n\nTry and hit the screen. Whoa.\n\nNearly killed someone.\n\nWhat g-force do F1 drivers experience?\n\nDepends if you crash or not.\n\nIt can be like 50 if you have a big shunt.\n\nA normal race, I guess like five,\n\nmaybe six in breaking.\n\nSustained. Peak.\n\nYeah. Peak.\n\nBecause peak is six in breaking and the sustained five in.\n\nCorners.\n\nTurn three in Barcelona, maybe.\n\nMaybe six for McLaren.\n\nBut biggest crash I've had is 46 G.\n\nAny big crashes?\n\nNever had one. The Miami one.\n\nThat hurt.\n\nI had it the year before.\n\nIn the concrete, no?\n\nI peed red the following day.\n\nOh. That's a nice.\n\nWow. That's disgusting.\n\nYeah, sorry guys.\n\nI was like, is that what he said or, wow.\n\nYeah, yeah. Why?\n\nIt was a high impact, yeah I don't know.\n\nDo F1 drivers ever think about anything other\n\nthan the race during the race?\n\nYes, we definitely do.\n\nIf it's a very boring race.\n\nThe party afterwards.\n\nHow slow can I go?\n\nI did a challenge in Monaco to try and do a full lap\n\nwithout doing full throttle.\n\nOh my god.\n\nAnd I managed it.\n\nI didn't lose any time actually.\n\nLots of focus.\n\n[drivers laugh]\n\nReaction time.\n\nF1 drivers don't fight.\n\nDo F1 drivers drive with both feet?\n\nIt's right foot break.\n\nYes.\n\nNo you don't actually, right foot break.\n\nNo.\n\nI break right foot.\n\nNo, he's kidding.\n\nYou almost believe me.\n\nNo, we, we, we drive with both feet.\n\nSo right foot is the throttle, left the break,\n\nand the clutch is on the hands.\n\nSo it's just for first gear, when we pull out the garage\n\nor we do the race start,\n\notherwise we don't need to use the clutch.\n\nThanks.\n\nWhen does the F1 season start?\n\nLate February, start of March.\n\nWhat fuel do F1 cars use?\n\nI have no idea.\n\nPetrol?\n\nNo, it's 10% ethanol and the rest is the race fuel\n\nthat's our providers basically.\n\nBut it's like super 98, no equivalent.\n\nSuper 98. No it's a hundred.\n\nIt's gotta be more than 98. It's 110 octane.\n\nYeah. Really?\n\nSo the ethanol is 114 and then we have a bit less.\n\nI had no idea.\n\nWhat's are F1 drivers' favorite circuits?\n\nCan we all agree it's Suzuka?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nYeah, agree.\n\nSuzuka's pretty cool, yeah.\n\nCan we all agree the next one might be?\n\nMonaco.\n\nMonaco is up there.\n\nMonaco?\n\nOn the quarter lap?\n\nNo quarter lap, Alex.\n\nI like Austin.\n\nI love Austin.\n\nSuzuka narrow, I would say.\n\nYou feel like there's a chance to crash\n\nwhich gives you the adrenaline.\n\nNo the risk and reward, I would say.\n\nYeah, when you finish a lap\n\nand your heart rates like this,\n\nthat's a good track.\n\nAre F1 cars all the same?\n\nYes.\n\nCompletely the same.\n\nThey're close enough so we can compete,\n\nbut then they're all completely.\n\nYes. Yes.\n\nEvery team makes their own car.\n\nAnd we are currently in the year\n\nof the closest ever year in F1.\n\nI think all cars are within eight tenths of each other.\n\nEight tenths is that after a lap,\n\nI could do a lap in a Ferrari, Mercedes, Red Bull,\n\nand then I jump in another car and I go eight tenths slower.\n\nBetween first and last is.\n\nBetween first and last.\n\nYeah, is eight tenths\n\nQuite impressive.\n\nBut what people need to know is that\n\nbetween F1 drivers there's no more than two or three tenths.\n\nSo those eight tens are, is still quite a lot.\n\nWhich F1 car is the fastest?\n\nMcLaren is the fastest.\n\nEveryone agrees, right?\n\nYes.\n\nIt's quite close.\n\nThis year's McLaren to the 2020 Mercedes actually.\n\nWhy is Formula 1 called Formula 1?\n\nBecause it's about formula two and three and four.\n\nNo, I think the way a car is built is a formula.\n\nIt's number one formula.\n\nYou know what I mean?\n\nIt's a good point, yeah.\n\nSo it's a formula of things.\n\nAnd it's the first one.\n\nIt's the top one.\n\nIt's the number one.\n\nNumber one. Yeah.\n\nWhy are F1 tires smooth?\n\nI think they mean why are they sleek?\n\nI'm thinking of it literally like why they're not square.\n\n[drivers laugh]\n\nTo offer the highest level of grip available for the tire.\n\nYes, yes.\n\nIf you put your hand like that,\n\nit's not gonna grip much.\n\nIf you put it like this, it grips more.\n\n[driver laughs]\n\nWhat F1 drivers are in the F1 movie?\n\nYou. All of us.\n\nI'm not in the movie.\n\nYes, you are in the title at the end.\n\nAt the title, in the credits?\n\nI've seen you in the credits.\n\nCarlos is clearly the one featured the most.\n\nHe has, he has a whole sentence.\n\nYeah, he does. Yeah.\n\nDude. It's a great scene.\n\nSpoiler alert.\n\nThose are all the questions.\n\nThanks for watching.\n\n[upbeat music]",
