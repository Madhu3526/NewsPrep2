  "text": "Miss Mexico Fatima Bosch has been crowned the new Miss Universe in Thailand on Friday - marking the end of an exceptionally scandal filled pageant season.\n\nThe 25-year-old contestant had earlier in November walked out of a pageant event after an official publicly berated her in front of dozens of contestants and threatened to disqualify those who supported her.\n\nA week after, two judges resigned, with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the competition.\n\nMiss Universe, founded in the US, is one of the longest-running beauty pageants on the planet. The recent controversies, analysts say, underscore the cultural and strategic differences between the pageant's Thai and Mexican owners.",
