Cheek curl.\n\nYeah, you know,\n\n155,\n\n160,\n\ncheek curl.\n\nAnd a strict curl, I don't know.\n\nI didn't do it so much because it's a very danger.\n\nYou could tell your muscles that I have.\n\nprobably about 110.\n\nWhich one's a cheat curl?\n\nIs that-\n\nCheat curls is when you use your body.\n\nSwing wheel,\n\nSwing.\n\nIt's a swing, yeah.\n\nYou do a lot more.\n\nI can do plenty of cheat curls.\n\nCan Sylvester Stallone [paper rips]\n\nride a horse?\n\nYeah, that's one thing I can do.\n\nI started out riding very, very early in riding very\n\ncantankerous horses\n\nbecause my father used to buy horses like for $35, $40.\n\nSo I learned to ride on that.\n\nAt one time I wanted to be a professional equestrian.\n\nThat was my goal.\n\nAnd I played amateur polo for until I was around 40.\n\nAnd then had my last game at\n\nthe field in Wellington in Florida.\n\nAnd I said, siyanara,\n\nbecause you cannot trust anything that can gallop\n\nand poop at the same time.\n\nThat is a, that is a good decision probably.\n\nThank you.\n\nIt seems hard with the polo stick,\n\nlike it's such a small ball, isn't it?\n\nIt literally like trying to hit a golf ball\n\nduring an earthquake with a blindfold.\n\nYeah. Yeah.\n\n[card flops]\n\nWow.\n\nThese won't be as interesting.\n\nThis will be, how did Martin Star\n\nget his start?\n\nI got lucky.\n\nThat's how it happened.\n\nI didn't hustle, probably as hard as you had to.\n\nI got, I got real lucky.\n\nI got a TV show at 16,\n\nAt 16?\n\nAnd then at 16 off to the races.\n\nYeah.\n\nWow, very good.\n\nHow old was Martin Starr when\n\n[paper rips]\n\nIn Freaks and Geeks,\n\n15 years old.\n\nStop.\n\nYou were, when you did, Rocky?\n\nHow old were you?\n\nI was right, like 29 and three quarters.\n\nI was right at the quarter down.\n\nYou weren't even 30.\n\nYou were counting the quarters though.\n\nYeah, for sure.\n\nI appreciate that.\n\nWho did Martin Starr\n\n[paper rips]\n\nplay in, Superbad?\n\nOne of the cokeheads.\n\nDo you guys, you guys ever heard of cocaine?\n\nI can see why they cast you because he speaks so quickly.\n\nMhm,\n\nyeah.\n\nOkay.\n\nMartin Star.\n\n[paper rips]\n\nHey, look at us, huh?\n\n♪ Going to the chapel ♪\n\n♪ And we're gonna get ♪\n\nWhat does that mean?\n\nPeople are Googling us.\n\n[Crew] Really? Yeah.\n\nWell we appreciate it.\n\nWe do.\n\nAnd we have a big surprise coming your way September 21st.\n\nCome and get it.\n\nHere we go.\n\nWhat is Tulsa King about\n\nwith Sylvester Stallone?\n\nDo we have a week?\n\nFirst of all, the first season was, I do a big favor.\n\nI'm in prison for 25 years, expecting\n\nto be rewarded when I get out.\n\nInstead I'm banished to Tulsa,\n\nwhich I have no idea who's there\n\nand have to build a new life.\n\nAnd I start to build it with very odd individual\n\nlike the man on my left here.\n\nAnd it turns out to be a great gathering\n\nof interesting characters.\n\nNot to brag.\n\nWhy did Sylvester Stallone\n\nwrite Rocky?\n\nBecause I was broke.\n\nI was really busted.\n\n[Martin laughs]\n\nIt was like the last shot, last moment.\n\nThis was it.\n\nWe're all in period.\n\nSo I wrote it\n\nbecause I realized I wasn't getting the kind\n\nof role I could really wrap my teeth around.\n\nI was always like the third guy through the door\n\nand I said, this is gonna be it.\n\nI'm gonna be like thug number three.\n\nSo why don't I write a story about a thug with a good heart?\n\nAnd actually he's a very interesting fellow\n\n'cause he had the same problems as everybody.\n\nSo people identify with this\n\nbecause it's more of a love story than a fight story.\n\nSo it had all the components,\n\nbut it was trillion to one shot.\n\nIt was a minor miracle.\n\nStill totally, yeah.\n\nWho did Sylvester Stallone base Rocky on?\n\nWell, I'm glad you asked that.\n\nA lot of people think it was based on a fellow named\n\nChuck Wepner, the Bayonne Bleeder.\n\nAnd I'll tell you, it was really based on Rocky Marciana,\n\nwho he and I were literally almost the same size.\n\nHe didn't stop start fighting until he was around 24.\n\nHe stopped in the fifties.\n\nSo I didn't think any, the studios hardly anyone,\n\nunless you were a boxing fan, would remember him.\n\nAnd coincidentally, Ali, Muhammad Ali,\n\nfought Chuck Wepner.\n\nChuck sort of stepped on his toe.\n\nAli got knocked down and it became a big deal.\n\nSo when I was trying to pitch the show to studios, I used\n\nthat as this is the possibility this could actually be quite\n\nrelevant and exciting.\n\nWhere this incredible underdog knocks down the ultimate.\n\nBecause everyone secretly wants to take one big shot at life\n\nand see if they can knock it down.\n\nSo that was the identification.\n\nWhat's the news on Sylvester Stallone?\n\nWhat's the news?\n\nWhat's the haps with Sylvester?\n\nWell, you know, we're getting ready for the next season.\n\nWe're gonna start filming at the end of October.\n\nWe premiere September 21st.\n\nSo we're doing a lot of work with the writers.\n\nTerence Winter, the original writer on it.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd we're coming up with a lot of surprises.\n\nSo that's pretty much it.\n\nAnd I'm finishing writing this biography about the genesis\n\nof Rocky, which is being done by Harpers and Collins.\n\nAnd that'll be out, I guess, springtime.\n\nAm I gonna get a free copy or?\n\nDefinitely.\n\n[paper flops]\n\nMartin.\n\nMartin Starr,\n\nBodhi.\n\nYep, I got taken over by the mob.\n\nBut he is also a mad genius that takes us to a new level.\n\nAnd next season we're really going places\n\nwith your AI brain.\n\nSo you heard it here first.\n\nThere you go.\n\nI just made it up.\n\n[Martin laughs]\n\nMartin Starr on Silicon Valley.\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe good old days.\n\nGilfoyle, Dinesh, Mike Judge and Alec Berg.\n\nThat was a good run.\n\nIt's a different vibe than a comedy,\n\nthan on a drama.\n\nI think there's, there's different focus.\n\nLike we get to do more action stuff\n\nand there's a lot more focus on making sure story beats\n\nare all connected\n\nand with comedy,\n\nyou're you kind of get to focus on\n\nthe play of it,\n\nwhich I guess we get to do a lot too.\n\nI know.\n\nBut this season you really get very dramatic.\n\nYou wound up in some scenes there\n\nand I don't think people, they just, oh wow.\n\nI thought he just does, you know, dry comedy?\n\nNo, no, no.\n\nNot at all.\n\nYou run the gamut.\n\nCongrats.\n\nMartin Starr,\n\n[paper rips]\n\nMCU crossover.\n\nI was in the Spider-Man\n\nand then technically I was also in the Hulk.\n\nKevin Feige once said\n\nthat the two characters were connected,\n\nbut I don't necessarily understand how that is.\n\nBut I respect his overall view of the MCU world.\n\nSo I won't disagree with him,\n\nbut I played a Pizza man at Hulk and then played a teacher\n\nand Mr. Harrington and Spider-Man.\n\nThat's the full spectrum man.\n\nHey, I've had a good run.\n\nMartin Star,\n\nglow up.\n\nGlow up TBD.\n\nWe're still working on it.\n\nIt'll happen.\n\nBut you know, patience.\n\nAppreciate your patience.\n\nWhat is it?\n\nGlow up is like when you go from being very\n\nunattractive to then all of a sudden you're now attractive.\n\n[laughs] Okay. So we're still working.\n\nWe're working our way there.\n\nI think you're getting taller every episode, just saying.\n\nYeah, no, I'm working.\n\nI'm adding vertebrae in.\n\nAll right, Sly, did you have fun?\n\nI, yeah, I did.\n\nGood hanging with you.\n\n[upbeat music]",
