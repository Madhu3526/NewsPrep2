  "text": "'Too little, too late': Covid inquiry highlights failures by UK's four governments\n\nAdam Goldsmith\n\nLive reporter\n\nImage source, PA Media\n\nAn 800-page Covid inquiry report today criticised the UK and devolved governments' reaction to the start of the coronavirus pandemic in early 2020.\n\nSumming up part two of 10 different subject areas - this time addressing decision making and political governance - inquiry chair Baroness Hallett said the actions of the UK's four governments \"repeatedly amounted to a case of ‘too little, too late’\".\n\nHad the government recognised the urgency and taken certain actions sooner, she suggested, the nationwide lockdown that began on 23 March 2020 may have been avoided - and 23,000 lives potentially saved in the first wave.\n\n\"That these same mistakes were repeated later in 2020 is inexcusable,\" she said.\n\nIt was a view shared by the Bereaved Families for Justice group, who today mourned the loss of relatives as they reacted next to the National Covid Memorial Wall - where hearts bear the names of some of the 227,000 who died between March 2020 and May 2023.\n\nWhat next? Prime Minister Keir Starmer says he'll carefully study Baroness Hallett's key recommendations, which include greater parliamentary scrutiny of emergency powers and improving consideration of vulnerable groups. And there will be further reports from the inquiry.\n\nThat brings our live coverage to a close, but for further reading our colleagues have news stories on the response to the report in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland, or we have a full overview here.",
