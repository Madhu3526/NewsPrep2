Launching in Las Vegas in May 2026, the games promise $1 million bounties for breaking world records and lean on a business model reminiscent of Red Bull’s, using the spectacle as marketing for future enhancement products.\n\nToday on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast, Rebecca Bellan spoke with Aron D’Souza, co-founder and president of the Enhanced Games, about the business of enhancement, what it means to build in the longevity space, and who gets to do it.\n\nSubscribe to Equity on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts.
