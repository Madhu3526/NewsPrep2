Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOpenAI is widely rolling out group chats inside ChatGPT, allowing you to invite up to 20 other people to your conversation with the AI chatbot. The feature is now available globally to all logged-in users, following a short pilot earlier this month.\n\nOpenAI positions the feature as a way to collaborate with friends, family members, or coworkers when doing things like organizing a dinner, creating travel plans, and drafting an outline — all with ChatGPT on board.\n\nYou create a group chat by selecting the “people” icon in the top-right corner of the ChatGPT app. ChatGPT will then copy your existing chat to a new group chat, where you can add others by sending them a link to your conversation (which they can also share). ChatGPT will prompt you to enter a name, username, and photo the first time you enter or create a group chat, making it easier to see who’s talking.\n\nOpenAI says it trained ChatGPT to go along with the “flow of the conversation,” which means it will try to determine the best times to chime in and when to stay quiet. You can directly mention “ChatGPT” in a message if you want a response from the chatbot. ChatGPT can also react to messages with emoji and reference profile photos when doing things like creating personalized images.\n\nYou can access various settings by selecting the group chat icon on the top-right corner of the screen, which houses options to add or remove people, mute notifications, and give custom instructions to ChatGPT. OpenAI notes that ChatGPT won’t use memories from your personal chats inside group conversations, nor will it create new memories based on your group chats.\n\nChatGPT uses GPT-5.1 Auto to power its responses in group chats, “which chooses the best model to respond with based on the prompt and the models available to the user that ChatGPT is responding to.” Rate limits will only apply when ChatGPT sends a message in the chat.",
