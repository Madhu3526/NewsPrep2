  "text": "Step 6\n\nWhen the squash is cool enough to handle, discard the sage sprigs. Scoop out the flesh with a spoon and add it to the pot, along with the roasted garlic cloves. Stir in the nutmeg, smoked paprika and cayenne (if using), then season with salt and pepper. Add 1 cup of broth and mash the mixture with a large whisk over low heat until a thick paste forms. (This mixture can be made up to 3 days ahead. Cool it completely and refrigerate in an airtight container. When ready to use, heat over low until warmed.)",
