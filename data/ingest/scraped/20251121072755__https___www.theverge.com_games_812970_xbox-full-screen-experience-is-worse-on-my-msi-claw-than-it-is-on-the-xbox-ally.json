  "text": "I had a bad weekend with Xbox Full Screen Experience preview on MSI Claw — but I’ll need to retest.\n\nCorrection: I originally wrote there was no way to bring up the task switcher on Claw — the best part of FSE — but that’s because MSI Center claimed I was on the latest BIOS when I wasn’t! With BIOS 10F, I can long-press Quick Settings to task-switch. Because that BIOS may have fixed other things too, I also need to re-test sleep (which wasn’t working for me).",
