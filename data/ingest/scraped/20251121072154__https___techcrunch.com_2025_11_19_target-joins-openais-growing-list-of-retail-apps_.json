  "text": "In Brief\n\nOpenAI is pushing deeper into retail, with Target set to debut a new ChatGPT-powered app for shoppers in coming weeks.\n\nThe news follows OpenAI’s move last month to start adding dedicated retail apps to ChatGPT, including Canva, Coursera, Figma, Expedia, Spotify, and Zillow. It also comes as OpenAI races to rake in AI-driven commerce via new products like “Instant Checkout” that let users make purchases within conversations with retailers like Etsy and Shopify.\n\nThe Target app in ChatGPT will launch in beta next week, and it will let shoppers ask for ideas, browse, and build multi-item baskets, shop for food, and check out, according to OpenAI.\n\nThe deal deepens OpenAI’s existing enterprise partnership with Target. Target will now roll out ChatGPT Enterprise across its 18,000 employees at its headquarters to be used for things like better supply chain forecasting and streamlining store processes. Target will also further integrate OpenAI’s models into digital tools that power everything from employee support and customer service to AI-driven shopping assistants and personalized gift finders.",
