  "text": "For the love of all that is great and good, could the New York Times cooking recipe writers PLEASE write when an ingredient is divided between two steps?! This calls for 4 Tbsp sesame oil, but I didn’t read closely enough to only add 3 of them in the first step. If the recipe list read, “4 Tbsp sesame oil, divided” as most recipes do, this would likely call my attention to this very early in the process, rather than having me just dump it all in and realize too late that that was too much.\n\nIs this helpful? 1104",
