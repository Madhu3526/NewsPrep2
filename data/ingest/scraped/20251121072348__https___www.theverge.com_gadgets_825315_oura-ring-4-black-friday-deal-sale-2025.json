If you’re curious to see why it’s such a great alternative to a smartwatch, you can snag the health tracker for as low as $249 at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. Discounts on the smart ring have been hard to come by since its launch over a year ago, and the latest deal brings it down to its lowest price yet.\n\nWhile the fourth-generation Oura Ring introduces relatively minor hardware changes, it offers several great software improvements over its predecessor. For instance, it features an algorithm that can accurately track your heart rate and blood oxygen levels, along with improved activity detection. It also tracks light workouts, stress levels, menstrual cycles, and other essential health metrics, all from your finger.\n\nHowever, to fully take advantage of what the Oura Ring 4 has to offer, you’ll need to subscribe to an Oura Membership, which runs $5.99 a month. With a membership, you’ll gain access to more detailed sleep analysis, 24/7 heart rate tracking, advanced temperature monitoring, and more. The subscription is easily the biggest downside of the Oura Ring 4, but the discount takes some of the sting out of the ongoing cost.\n\nIn addition to snagging an Oura Ring 4 for just $249, you can also pick up the gold and rose gold color options for $349 ($150 off). The stealth color option is down to $299 ($100 off), with sizes ranging from 4 to 15. Each model is made of durable titanium. Battery life lasts about a week, which is a notable upgrade over the three to four days of the previous model.\n\nVerge Deals Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.
