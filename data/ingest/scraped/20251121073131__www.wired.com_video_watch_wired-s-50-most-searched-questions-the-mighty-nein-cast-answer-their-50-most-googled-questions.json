  "text": "Transcript\n\nEverybody rock in your chairs for three seconds.\n\nThree, two, one.\n\n[chairs rustling] [cast laughing]\n\nPerfect.\n\nHi, we are the cast of The Mighty Nein,\n\nand we are here to discuss the top Googled questions\n\nabout The Mighty Nein.\n\n[upbeat energetic music]\n\nIs The Mighty Nein in the same world as Vox Machina?\n\nIt is. Go on, world builder.\n\nYes. It is.\n\nOut of this world.\n\nWhat's the name of the world?\n\nI don't know.\n\nNo, I mean, it's Tal Dorei.\n\nIt happens in in Tal-\n\nNo, it does not.\n\nExandria.\n\n[all cross-talking] What's happening?\n\nAre you deliberately trolling?\n\nKind of.\n\nYes, it all takes place in Exandria\n\nwhile Vox Machina takes place primarily in Tal Dorei\n\nand a little bit of of Vasselheim and Asura.\n\nThis takes place in a different continent called Wildemount,\n\nin which the politics are a little different.\n\nWhere does The Mighty Nein take place?\n\nAs previously stated. [everyone laughs]\n\nBut it's a good chance to mention the Kryn Dynasty.\n\nThat's true. Oh, yes.\n\nYes, in Wildmounts, there are two major factions\n\nat play with this story that involves the Dwendalian Empire\n\nand the Kryn Dynasty.\n\nAnd you'll have to watch the show\n\nto see how good a friends they are not.\n\nYou gotta take a gamble and throw it\n\nover your head once, see if you hit me in the eye.\n\nAll right, the question is, is Fjord a half-orc?\n\nHalf-orc, half-fuckin' stud.\n\n[all cheering] [all cross-talking]\n\n[bell dinging] [everyone laughing]\n\nHeard it here first.\n\nWhat city did The Mighty Nein first meet in?\n\n[everyone exults]\n\nCharleston Wald? Did we?\n\nCharleston Wald.\n\nWell done. Yeah.\n\nWow, the velocity on that! He did cosplay as gambit.\n\nI did. So-\n\nThat's all you gotta do, kids.\n\nWhy are The Mighty Nein called that?\n\n[everyone chatters]\n\nI love the way it's phrased.\n\n'Cause it sounds almost cynical.\n\nWe actually had a text thread about this,\n\ntrying to figure out what the group name was gonna be,\n\nand we came up with all sorts of amazing suggestions.\n\nAnd then I feel like you just took it over.\n\nI will agree with that,\n\nBut it's because Zemnian is an adopted version of German.\n\nAnd thematically is a big fat no\n\nto the corrupt powers that be.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd it just rolls off the tongue.\n\nIt does.\n\nWhat food is Jester known for eating?\n\nSweets, donuts, candy?\n\nPastries. Pastries? Cupcakes?\n\nCinnamon rolls?\n\nLollipops. Boom, done.\n\nBear cloths? How tall is Mollymauk?\n\nSix feet in heels.\n\nHe's very tall.\n\nHe's at least 5'11. 5'11.\n\nYeah. 5'11 is short.\n\nWhich city is Essek originally from?\n\nRosohna, which is the capital\n\nof the Kryn dynasty in Xhorhas,\n\nwhich is an area deeply scarred since the calamity\n\nin the history of Exandria.\n\nBut it is a perpetually night covered city.\n\nIt is the seat of the Kryn dynasty.\n\nIt's pretty cool.\n\nYou should check it out. For bonus points,\n\ncan anyone spell it? R-O-H-\n\nNo? S-A-H-N-N-H-A-H.\n\nSam got it none.\n\nGo for it. What weapon\n\nis Yasha most known for wielding?\n\nOoh.\n\nWell there's two. Yeah.\n\nWe have the Skingorger.\n\nSkingorger.\n\nJust to make sure that you knew what it was.\n\nAnd the Magician's Judge.\n\nWhat is Dunamancy?\n\n[everyone exults]\n\nYou should answer that one, Marisha.\n\nYeah, go for it. Magic.\n\n[everyone laughs]\n\nI mean, not really.\n\nYou can elaborate. It's cool magic.\n\nNo, it's a fundamental magical force\n\nthat is mysterious across most of Exandria\n\nthat is steeped into an entity called the Luxon\n\nthat is a mythological core of the Kryn Dynasty's religion.\n\nBut it is more or less a magic that can seem to tamper\n\nwith time, space, gravity,\n\nand is quite powerful and mysterious.\n\nSo Dunamancy wouldn't exist without the Luxon?\n\nYou don't know.\n\nOkay. He'll never tell us.\n\nIt's like you-\n\nYou get it all together, but it's already there.\n\nHere, Sam. This question is,\n\nwhat did Jester, oh, that's Laura's character,\n\ndo to Braius, my character. Absolutely nothing.\n\nShe's never done anything wrong in her entire life.\n\n[everyone laughs]\n\nShe ruined his life. Whoa!\n\nHe was assigned to protect a temple\n\nand Jester destroyed it.\n\nThereby-\n\nShould have done a job better.\n\nGetting him fired and causing him to turn to the dark side\n\nand follow the Prince of Darkness.\n\nBut it wasn't malicious. I mean, it was intentional.\n\nBreak you down to build you up again.\n\nIt's true.\n\nIt all works out at the end. It all works out.\n\nWhat is the Dynasty's word\n\nfor souls that have been reborn?\n\nConsecution. Consecution.\n\nVery good. Ding, ding, ding.\n\nWell done. Spell it.\n\nR-O-H. [everyone laughs]\n\nHere we go. Oh,\n\nwhat language does Caleb Widogast speak?\n\nHe speaks the language of Zemnian,\n\nwhich is remarkably similar but not identical to German.\n\nSlightly different accent.\n\nYeah, it's coming back.\n\nWhat is Mollymauk's real name before he became Mollymauk?\n\nWell, Molly doesn't know,\n\nso I don't know why you should either.\n\nYou will find out but I will say it's mysterious.\n\nOh, he doesn't wanna answer. No, I don't.\n\nI feel like this is like a spoiler.\n\nMarisha?\n\nYes. What kind of monk\n\nis Beauregard?
