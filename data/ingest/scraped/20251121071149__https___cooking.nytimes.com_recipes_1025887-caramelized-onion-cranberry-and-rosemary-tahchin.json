  "title": "Caramelized Onion, Cranberry and Rosemary Tahchin Recipe",
  "text": "Tahchin is a Persian rice dish in which the rice is mixed with yogurt, oil, egg yolks and saffron and baked until a golden crust forms at the bottom (Persians refer to this as the tahdig). The rice on the inside becomes buttery and almost cake-like and is often layered with chicken and barberries, a tart dried fruit that has a beautiful crimson color. This version incorporates common Thanksgiving ingredients like rosemary, sweet-tart cranberries and buttery onions to make a striking dish that feels more like a main than a side. It’s deeply savory and buttery, like stuffing, and some may say even better because it has a whole lot more texture coming from the crispy rice that everyone will be fighting over.",
