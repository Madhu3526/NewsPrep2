  "title": "Roasted Red Pepper and Feta Cornbread Recipe",
  "text": "While there’s nothing wrong with a pan of classic cornbread, this recipe makes for a fun twist when the occasion calls for something a little bit more festive. Jarred roasted red peppers not only add a pop of color, but also a juicy, vinegary tang that balances the richness of the cornbread and helps keep it moist and tender. The feta softens but doesn’t melt, leading to satisfying little pockets of cheese in each piece. Finally, thanks to the sour cream in the batter, this cornbread won’t dry out overnight. To make in advance, fully cool the cornbread, then cover with plastic wrap and store at room temperature for up to 24 hours before serving.",
