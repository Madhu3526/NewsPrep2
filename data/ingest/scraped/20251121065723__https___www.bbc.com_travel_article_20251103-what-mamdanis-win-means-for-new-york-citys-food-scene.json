  "text": "By building much of his campaign on food and championing \"hidden gems\" in lesser-known parts of the city, NYC's new mayor is changing how New Yorkers and travellers eat.\n\nZohran Mamdani's historic win in New York City's mayoral election is likely to transform the US's largest and most-visited city in many ways. But even before taking office, his unprecedented rise is already changing the city's food scene, and if his campaign is any indication, the next four years may encourage travellers and residents alike to visit new neighbourhoods and become more adventurous eaters.\n\nMamdani has long leaned into his love of food to speak to New Yorkers. Before entering politics, he was a rapper who went by the name Mr Cardamom and filmed a music video with Indian culinary legend Madhur Jaffrey in a kebab house in Queens. In 2020, he ran for the New York State Assembly under the slogan \"Roti and Roses\". Since announcing his mayoral candidacy one year ago, he's campaigned at bodegas in the Bronx, taken politicians to an Afghan eatery in Astoria, organised a city-wide scavenger hunt that concluded at his favourite Middle Eastern cafe and consistently championed family-run \"hidden gems\" in the city's outer boroughs where many tourists typically don't travel.\n\nIn doing so, Mamdani is putting under-the-radar eateries on the map that are miles away (literally and figuratively) from some of the city's trendiest dining destinations. He's also drawing a stark contrast between himself and his predecessor Eric Adams, who frequented flashy club-style restaurants like Midtown's Osteria La Baia or Casa Cipriani in The Battery.",
