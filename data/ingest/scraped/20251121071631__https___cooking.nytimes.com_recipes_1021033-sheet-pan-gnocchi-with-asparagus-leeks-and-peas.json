  "text": "The sensation of eating gnocchi crisp is different. We liked it. Why put the 2 sheet pans in the oven at the same time, if you expect their contents will cook for different lengths of time? That said, how long the asparagus should cook depends on its thickness: Ours was very thin, done in 17 mins. Gnocchi crispy in 15-17 mins. Cut gnocchi quantity in 1/2 for 2 but didn’t reduce the vegetables. Added garlic. Maybe a splash or 2 of lemon juice and a pinch of red pepper flakes, too?\n\nIs this helpful? 181",
