  "text": "The 47-year-old JetBlue pilot went to a barbecue, where he ate a hamburger, at roughly 3 p.m. He returned to his suburban New Jersey home and mowed the lawn for an hour. By 7:20, he was in the bathroom, vomiting. By 7:37, he was unconscious. Soon, his son was trying to resuscitate him.\n\nThe pilot, Brian Waitzel, was declared dead later that night. The conclusion of an autopsy: “Sudden unexplained death.”\n\nNow, more than a year after Mr. Waitzel died, a team of doctors say they have found an answer.\n\nThe physicians linked his death to a growing menace: an allergy to red meat triggered by a tick bite. They published their findings last week in a medical journal, asserting that it is the first death of its kind linked to the tick-borne allergy, called alpha-gal syndrome.",
