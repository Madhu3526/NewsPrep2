  "title": "Pili Pili Shrimp with Braised Cannellini Beans Recipe",
  "text": "Pili pili is the Swahili word for chile, and this recipe uses three common pantry varieties, each bringing something different when it comes to spice level, color and flavor. When sizzled with garlic in olive oil, the chiles create a flavorful marinade, infusing the shrimp with spice but not spiciness. The chiles here are all quite mellow, so that none upstage the others. Instead of adding cilantro as a garnish, here it's added earlier in cooking so it has a more gentle flavor, a trick learned from my grandmother Agnes.",
