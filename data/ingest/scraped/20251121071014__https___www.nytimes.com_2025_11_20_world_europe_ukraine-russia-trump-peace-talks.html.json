  "text": "President Volodymyr Zelensky said on Thursday that Ukraine would engage “constructively, honestly and operationally” on a peace plan that the Trump administration proposed after consulting with Russia — but not with Ukraine.\n\nThe 28-point settlement plan echoes long-held Russian demands, including that Ukraine surrender territory, limit the size of its army and forgo any role for a Western peacekeeping force after a cease-fire, according to officials familiar with the proposal.\n\nMr. Zelensky’s comments came after a meeting with the U.S. Army secretary, Dan Driscoll, whom the Trump administration had sent to Ukraine to help restart peace talks. Mr. Zelensky said American and Ukrainian teams would begin work on what he described as the “points of the plan to end the war,” without elaborating on what those were.\n\nWhile Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, confirmed the plan’s existence earlier on Thursday, the Trump administration has not laid out the full proposal, which Ms. Leavitt said was still in “flux.”",
