  "text": "Tax measures dominate this week's PMQs\n\nJack Grey\n\nLive reporter\n\nIn the Commons today, Badenoch pressed Starmer over whether the government would \"break another promise\" by freezing income tax thresholds. The prime minister refused to rule this out, but said the chancellor would set out her plans in the 26 November Budget.\n\nStarmer insisted that the Labour Budget won't inflict a borrowing spree like former Conservative prime minister \"Liz Truss did\".\n\nIt comes after Rachel Reeves backed away from raising income tax rates last week after better-than-expected economic forecasts.\n\nBadenoch again asked the PM to confirm the government would not break its promise and continue the freeze on income tax thresholds.\n\nBut Starmer dodged the question, only saying the Budget would focus on cutting NHS waiting lists, debt and the cost-of-living.\n\nBadenoch also ridiculed Labour for \"wanting an applause\" due to inflation \"coming down a bit\" - a reference to inflation dropping to its lowest level in four months to 3.6% - to which Starmer pointed out the 11% rate under the Tories during its term.\n\nWe're wrapping up our coverage now but you can read more from our politics team and we hope to see you next week for the Budget.",
