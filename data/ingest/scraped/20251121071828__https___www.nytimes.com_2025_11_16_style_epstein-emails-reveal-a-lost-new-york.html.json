  "text": "Washington went nuts — and the White House went on the defensive — after lawmakers dumped more than 20,000 emails belonging to Jeffrey Epstein into the public domain on Wednesday. The central intrigue was the late financier’s relationship with the president, but there were other stories buried in the mass of documents.\n\nThe emails are like a portal back to a lost Manhattan power scene. Mr. Epstein’s inbox was larded with boldface names — many of them now faded or forgotten — that once meant everything to status-obsessed New Yorkers. It was the world that Donald Trump came out of, and the one that Mr. Epstein had so effectively beguiled after having grown up in a middle-class household in Coney Island.\n\nAs the emails stretch through the years, they show how that protected realm vanished into the mists of time, pulled under by the rising forces of the internet and the #MeToo movement. Mr. Epstein and some of his male correspondents seem to squirm as they notice society changing around them.\n\nThe bulk of the documents come from an email address (jeevacation@gmail.com) that was set up around 2009, when Mr. Epstein was released from the Palm Beach County jail after having served 13 months of an 18-month sentence on a reduced charge of soliciting prostitution. It wasn’t exactly hard time: Florida officials allowed him to spend 12 hours a day, six days a week, outside the facility.",
