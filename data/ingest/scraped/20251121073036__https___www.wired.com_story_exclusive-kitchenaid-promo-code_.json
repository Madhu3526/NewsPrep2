  "text": "KitchenAid’s strategy is one that maybe we should all live by—if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. Remaining nearly unchanged since its introduction in 1914, KitchenAid’s stand mixer has become such a legendary kitchen staple that we called the KitchenAid Artisan 7-Quart Lift Stand Mixer an “everlasting” kitchen must-have and put it on our Buy It For Life guide. KitchenAid’s heralded and beloved kitchen appliances luckily run regular sales so that you can get these great, but pricey, essentials for less.\n\nSave up to $250 With These KitchenAid Black Friday Promo Codes and Deals\n\nOne of the best perks of shopping online at KitchenAid are the rotating deals and discounts on some of their best-selling appliances.\n\nIf you’re in the market for a new refrigerator, oven, or other major appliance, now is a great time to buy. Now through December 3, when you buy 2 major appliances, you can get 10% off (or 15% off when you buy 3+). You can also get free delivery and haul away on major appliances (worth $399) when you’re signed in (through the same date).\n\nScore 15% Off With a KitchenAid Professional Discount\n\nSpeaking of great offers, there are other KitchenAid promo codes specifically for essential workers, like teachers, students, healthcare workers, military, first responders - and those over 50. If you are a member of one of those groups, all you need to do is verify your account with SheerID to receive the extra discounts (on top of any other accounts if you are an account holder). The verification form is in the “Profile Information” tab under “My Account” on KitchenAid’s site. Don’t fall into one of these categories? No worries! Those who have recently moved can also save 15%.\n\nEnjoy Year-Round Savings at KitchenAid\n\nEven without a discount code on hand, you can still save with regular deals, like great savings on refurbished items and free delivery on all appliances sitewide. Account holders also get access to exclusive perks and discounts sitewide—all you have to do is create an account. Be on the lookout for other great savings events from KitchenAid (like a discount on that mixer you’ve been eyeing all year long).\n\nHow to Redeem a KitchenAid Promo Code\n\nWhether you’re shopping for a highly-rated cold brew coffee maker, a 5-speed hand mixer that's great for saving countertop space, or a quiet electric kettle, we have the best KitchenAid promo codes to help you save on all your for-life kitchen products. When you’ve found a deal you want to use, like one of our promo codes listed above, simply paste the code in the box at checkout to save (remember to double-check whether you need to sign up for an account first). If the deal doesn’t require a special coupon, just put it in your cart, and the sale will be automatically applied—easy as pie.",
