  "title": "Chicken and Broccoli Rabe Pasta Recipe",
  "text": "The combination of pasta, garlic and olive oil has long been one of the best ways to feed many mouths with ease. Here, that garlicky pasta is joined by browned chunks of chicken, tender and bitter broccoli rabe and spicy cherry peppers. Browning boneless, skinless chicken breast takes little effort if done right — the key is to not overcrowd the pan. The chicken cooks through quickly, so sautéing it in batches adds minimal time and maximum flavor to this recipe. Feel free to use broccolini instead of broccoli rabe, sweet cherry peppers instead of spicy or even another short pasta instead of cavatelli — just don’t skip the freshly grated Parmesan on top.",
