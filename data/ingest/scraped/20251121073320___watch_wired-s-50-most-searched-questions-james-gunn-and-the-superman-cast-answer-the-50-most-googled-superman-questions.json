Superman's people.\n\nSuperman, we're his people.\n\nWe're gonna answer\n\nthe most Googled questions about Superman.\n\n[upbeat electronic music]\n\n[mouse clicking]\n\nAll right, you do the first one.\n\nAre Superman and Supergirl cousins?\n\nYes. Yes.\n\n[bell chiming] Good, next one.\n\nCan Superman breathe in space?\n\nOf course he can't breathe in space.\n\nNo? [bell chiming]\n\nNo, there's no air in space.\n\nThere's no air in space.\n\nThat's easy. But he could...\n\nDon't bring up the more specifics.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nDoes Luthor know Superman's identity?\n\nAs in Clark Kent?\n\nNo.\n\nObviously, yes.\n\nHm, no? Well, he knows\n\nwho Superman is, but he doesn't know his-\n\nNo, he doesn't know\n\nthat it's Clark Kent, no. He doesn't know\n\nhe's Clark Kent. No, he doesn't know that.\n\nYeah. Sometimes?\n\nWell, there's all...\n\nYou know, DC Comics has a rich history\n\nof alternate stories and, you know, else world tales\n\nand so, there've been times\n\n[bell chiming] when he's known who he is,\n\nbut usually not, or find out, or he finds out\n\nand gets a mind ray that makes him forget.\n\nHow does Superman fly?\n\nThinks about it\n\nreally, really hard. Next question.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nIt definitely takes effort, that's for sure.\n\nIt's like treading water, but he's just really good at it.\n\nBut how does it happen, he just thinks about it?\n\nDon't...\n\nWhat is considered the best Superman comic?\n\nLuthor: Man of Steel.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nI think it would-\n\nLois Lane: Superman's Girlfriend.\n\nGenerally, there are two series\n\nthat would be considered the greatest Superman comics.\n\nJeph Loeb and Tim Sale's,\n\nSuperman for All Seasons, [bell chiming]\n\nand it is Grant Morrison and Frank Quitely's\n\nAll-Star Superman,\n\nbut Alan Moore's Superman story is one of the best,\n\nWhatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow,\n\nand a lot of other different versions too\n\nthat are really great, so...\n\nHow did Superman get his powers?\n\nHe was born with them, right?\n\nHe just has them\n\nbecause he's on Earth? Well, he's born with\n\nthe potential for them, but they come out\n\nbecause he grows up on a planet with a yellow sun.\n\n[bell chiming] Yep.\n\nThat's where he got them.\n\nWho is the new Superman?\n\nMe.\n\n[bell chiming]\n\n[Rachel laughs]\n\nWhat is Superman's real name?\n\nWell, there's two, I mean...\n\nSuperman.\n\n[all laughing] That is his real name.\n\nSuperman. Super...\n\nObviously. Superman's real name\n\nis Superman. [Rachel laughs]\n\nHis legal name is Clark Kent,\n\ngiven to him by his adopted parents.\n\nHis original name is Kal-El. [bell chiming]\n\nWait, can I add a question?\n\nYeah. Does Clark Kent\n\nhave a social security number?\n\nYes. No, I just\n\nthought about that.\n\nWhen do his parents\n\napply for it? Why is it so obvious?\n\nThey went through a whole rigmarole\n\nof faking his adoption and all that stuff.\n\nDid you just make that up?\n\nNo, that's true.\n\nWill Superman 2025 be good?\n\nNo, it will be great.\n\n[all laughing] Ah!\n\n[bell chiming]\n\n[James] [laughs] Oh, that's a good one.\n\nWhat is so special about Lois Lane?\n\n[all laughing] I ask that all the time.\n\nWhy are people Googling this?\n\nShe's a brilliant journalist.\n\nShe's courageous.\n\nYes. And she will do\n\njust about anything in pursuit of truth and justice.\n\nAnd she's one of only a handful of humans,\n\nmaybe only two, who can really match Superman.\n\nThat's true. And call him on his...\n\nShit, yeah, both here.\n\nTough table. This is...\n\nWhy is Lex Luthor bald?\n\nWell...\n\nBecause he has no hair.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nNo, there's different reasons, actually,\n\nin different media. What's your reason?\n\nSome where it's Superman's fault.\n\nThere's some where he was caught in a fire because of it.\n\nThere's some where\n\nhe's just balding. Yeah, yeah.\n\nWhat other reasons were there?\n\nThere's a...\n\nThat he shaves his head. Yeah.\n\nThat he does it on purpose.\n\nSo, yeah, it just depends on...\n\nWhy were you bald? Yeah, what's yours?\n\nBecause it looks cool.\n\nOh, yes. Yeah, he does\n\nlook cool, yeah. It's true, yeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nWhere did Superman grow up?\n\nIn his house.\n\nThat's Smallville. [bell chiming]\n\nI wish I knew the zip code, but I don't.\n\nWhat does the S on Superman's suit mean?\n\nThe idea is that it's not actually an S,\n\nit just sort of looks like an S to human beings,\n\nbut it's the symbol of hope. [bell chiming]\n\nIt means hope sort of\n\nin the House of... It means S, it's Superman.\n\nOh, sorry, geez. [James laughs]\n\nIsn't that not true, though?\n\nI thought you were onto it. Again, it's all different\n\nthings in different media. Sometimes, it's the symbol\n\nof the House of El, sometimes\n\nit's a symbol of hope. Yeah.\n\nIt often is a symbol of the House of El.\n\nThat's one of the things I like about our S,\n\nis that it sort of doesn't...\n\nIt isn't an S. It doesn't, yeah.\n\nIt looks less like an S. It's cool, yeah.\n\nWhat does Superman do with his clothes when he changes?\n\nIn the comics, he puts them in a slot on his cape.\n\n[bell chimes]\n\nAnd in our movie, he eats them.\n\n[all laughing] He eats them,\n\npoops 'em out when he's done.\n\nWhy can Superman fly but other Kryptonians can't?\n\nOther Kryptonians can fly if they're on Earth,\n\n[bell chiming] so like when General Zod,\n\nor you know, Kara, who's his cousin, Supergirl,\n\ncomes to earth, they can also fly.\n\nCan Superman breathe underwater?\n\nYeah.\n\n[laughs] Can you?\n\nI mean, I think, yeah. You can hold your breath\n\na really long time, I bet.\n\nYou can't breathe underwater.\n\n[bell chiming] You don't think\n\nI can breathe in the water... But there's...\n\nYou haven't got gills. And then extract the oxygen\n\nfrom the water? I was gonna say,\n\nthere's oxygen under there. I don't think so.\n\nOkay. No?\n\nNo, I think your...\n\nHis body basically works like a human body,\n\nexcept for the flying stuff.\n\nYou could hold your breath a really long time, though.\n\nAnd some other things as well.\n\n[James laughs]\n\nThat Lois enjoys.\n\nWhy can no one tell who Superman is?\n\nGlasses. 'Cause he wears a\n\nvery tricky pair of glasses, [bell chiming]\n\nbut we actually get into it in the movie.\n\nMm-hmm. So, you'll see,\n\nif you go see Superman in theaters July 11th, you'll see.\n\nWhen was Superman created?\n\n1930...\n\n1928?\n\n26.\n\n24.\n\n22, 25. What did you say?\n\n36.\n\n38. Yeah.\n\n[bell chiming] I was\n\nthinking 30-something. 38 was his first appearance.\n\nIt was his first appearance.\n\nHe was created several years earlier\n\nin the basement of the house in Cleveland, Ohio\n\nby Jerry Siegel. Yes, yes.\n\nIt just took him a while to get published.\n\nThere was also a different kind of weirder version.\n\nYes. If you see those\n\nearly drawings where Superman was a much different\n\nsort of character. I don't think\n\nI've seen those. It wasn't what we\n\nwould think of as a superhero.\n\nWhere was Superman born?\n\nHe was born on Krypton. Krypton.\n\nWhat is Lois Lane's weakness?\n\nSuperman.\n\nThe sexiness of Superman.\n\nAnd his heart.\n\nAnd a good strong cup of coffee.\n\nThat always gets her. She does love\n\na cup of coffee.\n\nSugar. But it has to have\n\n30 sugars in it. Yeah.\n\nWho is playing Lex Luthor in the new Superman movie?\n\nMe.\n\nWell, Nick, who? I Googled that.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nThat's why it's on the list.\n\nAnd it's me. [bell chiming]\n\nWho's playing Green Lantern in Superman?\n\nI mean, you know him best, you tell them.\n\nNathan Fillion. [bell chiming]\n\nWhere does Superman live?\n\nMetropolis. [bell chiming]\n\nYes.\n\nWhat kind of a dog is Superdog?\n\nI guess they're saying Krypto the Superdog,\n\nbut nobody really calls him Superdog.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, what kind of dog is Krypto?\n\nKrypto in our movie\n\nis based on my dog, Ozu,\n\nwho is a total mutt\n\n[bell chiming] and the world's worst dog.\n\nAnd that was the inspiration for the whole movie,\n\nwas this terrible, terrible, terrible dog.\n\nYou love him.\n\n[James sighs]\n\nYou made a character of him in Superman.\n\nYou love him. As an adversary.\n\nThat's it. No, I love my dog,\n\nhe's the best...\n\nThat's the headline. He's a sweetheart,\n\nhe loves to be loved. James Gunn hates his dog.\n\nBut he didn't like me at first.\n\nHe really did not like me. I have one of those too.\n\nMy dog didn't like anyone. Yeah, yeah,\n\nhe loves me now. He's not gonna be happy\n\nwhen he sees this. [all laughing]\n\nDoes Superman change in a telephone booth?\n\nNot since people don't make calls in telephone booths.\n\n[bell chiming] Does he change inside\n\nhis cell phone now?\n\n[laughs] Yes, he does. In an iPhone.\n\nWhat is Superman's famous line?\n\nAm I missing something obvious?\n\nThe thing that comes to mind is...\n\nWell, I guess it's,\n\n[bell chiming] I stand for truth, justice,\n\nand the American way.\n\nThe line that always comes to mind for me\n\nis when he says, A friend, to Lois.\n\nOh, I like that, yeah.\n\nHe doesn't really have a...\n\nI mean, like,\n\nI'd guess, you know... Up, up and away.\n\nLike Batman, you'd...\n\nUp, up and away is...\n\nYeah, I guess.\n\nBut you never really\n\nsee him say it. Saying that about himself.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nThat's how he flies. That's how he flies.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nYeah, yeah, he says the magic words.\n\nUp, up and away. I think he has\n\na lot of famous phrases that are around him,\n\nbut he doesn't have a...\n\nYou know, like Batman says,\n\nI'm Batman, right. I'm Batman.\n\nAnd so, people always say that.\n\nIt was just from the\n\nMichael Keaton version of the character, but...\n\nI guess we say, It's a bird, it's a plane.\n\nOh, it's Superman. Oh, this one you're...\n\nThis one you're gonna like. Oh.\n\nDoes that mean I'm gonna hate it?\n\nYou're gonna like it, no, you're gonna\n\nlike it for real. Oh.\n\nDoes Lois Lane ever get powers?\n\nYes, she does. [bell chiming]\n\nBoy, does she.\n\nShe becomes Superwoman for a day on her birthday.\n\nIn All-Star Superman. In All-Star Superman.\n\nAnd there's other where she gets powers.\n\nYeah, like now. Like right now\n\nin the comics, you can go see her.\n\nShe has superpowers in the comics as we speak.\n\nJames, are you feeling inspired?\n\nYeah, maybe.\n\nI think about it every time I see her with powers, I'm like,\n\nI know... I've been saying this\n\nfrom the beginning. I know it's Rachel's.\n\nShe was so happy to be cast as Lois Lane,\n\nand another part of her was like,\n\nI want to be able to fly and...\n\nTell James you want a sequel where Lois Lane flies.\n\nOh, my God, that's all I'm gonna hear\n\non Threads, you know. [David laughs]\n\n[Rachel laughs]\n\nWhat happens to Superman when he touches kryptonite?\n\nHe gets weak.\n\n[bell chiming] Yeah.\n\nYeah, well, it's poison. He doesn't even need to\n\ntouch it, it would burn him very badly.\n\nYeah, it would screw him up,\n\njust being around... He gets radiation poisoning.\n\nYeah, being around kryptonite\n\nkills him eventually. Spoiler alert.\n\nWhy does Lex hate Superman?\n\nBecause he's everything he wants to be.\n\n[bell chiming]\n\nOh. Oh.\n\nThat's so nice. That's pretty sad.\n\n[Rachel laughs]\n\nHow rich is Lex Luthor? Billions, billionaire.\n\n[bell chiming] [Rachel laughs]\n\nSo much money. Many times over,\n\nyeah. Yeah, oh, yeah,\n\nsuper, super rich.\n\nMaxwell Lord, Simon Stagg and Lex Luthor,\n\nthey're kind of this billionaires' club\n\nand they're all different levels of malicious\n\nor mischievous,\n\nand Max was probably the best of them\n\nbecause he, you know, has funded the group in the movie.\n\nMm, secret stuff.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nCan't talk about.\n\nWhat is Superman's middle name?\n\nDanger.\n\nJustin. [David laughs]\n\nJustin. [all laughing]\n\nW.\n\nIs it?\n\nYou know, I gave that one to you\n\n'cause I didn't wanna have to answer it.\n\nDoes Clark Kent have a middle name?\n\nI'm embarrassed that I don't know.\n\nHe does? He does?\n\nHe does. What is it?\n\nWhat's his middle name? Joseph.\n\nI was so close. [laughs]\n\nClark Joseph.\n\nHis middle, Clark Kent, oh, what, you just asked that.\n\nClark Joseph Kent is his middle name.\n\n[bell chiming] He's trying to take\n\nthe win for the edit. Yeah.\n\n[both laughing]\n\nWho is the bad guy in Superman 2025?\n\nYou're looking at him.\n\n[bell chiming] [Nick clicks tongue]\n\n[Rachel laughs]\n\nI thought you were gonna say Superman.\n\nIt probably is Superman. [all laughing]\n\nYou decide.\n\nYou decide.\n\nJury's out.\n\nWhy doesn't Superman kill?\n\nHmm.\n\nI think the main reason is that\n\nhe sees the good in just about everybody,\n\nmaybe to a fault,\n\nand so he even sees the good\n\nin those trying to do him harm.\n\n[bell chiming] Yeah, I believe\n\nhe believes in a basic right to life.\n\nI mean, I think that's just not in him.\n\nBut I also don't...\n\nI'm not a purist in that respect.\n\nI think that if, for instance, he had to kill\n\nto protect somebody's life,\n\nhe would probably do that,\n\neven though that would be hard for him.\n\nWho is Clark Kent's biological mother?\n\nLara.\n\n[bell chiming] Lara, yeah.\n\nLara? Yeah.\n\nWhy does Bizarro Superman look the way he does?\n\nWell, because he's bizarre and he's from Bizarro planet\n\nand he looks like a crazy man.\n\nI think he looks better.\n\nThan Superman, I bet you do.\n\n[all laughing]\n\nWhy is Superman weak to kryptonite?\n\nOh. Because it's not\n\nfrom your planet? What's the mechanism?\n\nYeah, explain the science.\n\nI don't really understand the science behind it.\n\nWell, we understand it.\n\nThe three of us understand it very well,\n\nso why don't you explain it to us?\n\nThis is like a quiz. Well, when you're\n\non Krypton with kryptonite,\n\nvery rare rock,\n\nyou have to... [all laughing]\n\nI don't know.\n\nWhat's the reason?\n\nBecause it's really bad for you.\n\n[all laughing] Who is Superman's\n\nbest friend?\n\nLois Lane.\n\nNo. Superman's best...\n\nSuperman's best pal, Jimmy Olsen.\n\nJimmy. [bell chiming]\n\nOh.\n\n[Rachel laughs] They love each other too.\n\nYou see in the movie,\n\nthey love each other. Yeah, it's really sweet.\n\nAh, Skyler.\n\nWhat a great guy. Yeah.\n\nAre all Kryptonians as strong as Superman?\n\nWell, relatively, but you know, he's...\n\nThey would be the same as if...\n\nSo, like, if he was to fight Kara,\n\nwho's his cousin and smaller than him, it would be...\n\nHe's bigger, so yeah,\n\nbut basically, they all have superpowers\n\nif they come to the planet. I also like to think that\n\nhis upbringing on Earth has given him\n\ncertain grit and oomph...\n\nI think that's true. That would help him,\n\nyou know, just outlast an equal Kryptonian opponent.\n\nYeah, maybe, maybe.\n\nHe's pretty good at fighting. Yeah.\n\nLittle extra oomph. Yeah.\n\nBoy, some of these have gone far.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou're gonna have to pick all these up when we're done.\n\nWhat is Superman's suit made of?\n\nI'm done helping you.\n\nLex's tears.\n\nWhat do you make it out of? Well, there's\n\ndifferent things in different stories.\n\nOftentimes, it is the blankets that he was swaddled in\n\n[bell chiming] that his mother\n\nturned into his suit when he came to Earth.\n\nIn our movie, we don't answer that yet.\n\nWhat version of Green Lantern\n\nis in the new Superman movie?\n\nThat's a good question.\n\nGG. [bell chiming]\n\nGuy Gardner. Guy Gardner.\n\nCan Superman fly without his suit?\n\nYes, [bell chiming]\n\nbut you don't get that in this movie.\n\nCan Superman go back in time like the Flash?\n\nOnly in the Richard Donner 1979 version\n\nof Superman: The Movie. He turns back\n\ntime to save Lois. But yeah.\n\nBut I think that if that happened in our movie,\n\nthe world would go backwards\n\nand that means everyone would just be crushed and die\n\n[all laughing]\n\nand Superman would land on the crushed earth\n\nand be like, Oh, no, what did I do?\n\nA little sheepish.\n\nI didn't make time go backwards.\n\nI just killed everyone on the planet\n\n'cause I wanted to save my girlfriend.\n\nAh.\n\nThank you. Thanks, guys.\n\nThat's a lot of Googling of Superman. [laughs]\n\nYeah. [ethereal music]",
