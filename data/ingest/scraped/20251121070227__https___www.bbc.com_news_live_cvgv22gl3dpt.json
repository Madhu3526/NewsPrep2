There's also an amber warning in northern England which lasts until 21:00 today.\n\nThe Met Office says there's a chance of more \"thundersnow\" today too - that's when a thunderstorm meets freezing snowy conditions.\n\nLooking ahead, the cold weather is set to continue. New yellow weather warnings for ice have been issued today, lasting until tomorrow. These cover parts of south-west and eastern England, Scotland and west Wales.\n\nIf you're in an affected area, stay safe. We've got guides on keeping your home warm, driving safely if you have to, and looking after your pets.\n\nIf you’re already physically warm and after something heartwarming, these dogs and guinea pigs you’ve sent in might just do the trick.\n\nWe are closing our live coverage now, but our news story will remain updated with the latest on the cold weather and any new warnings which are issued.\n\nThanks for joining us. Stay warm.",
