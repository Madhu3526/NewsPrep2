  "text": "Stocks in South Korea, Taiwan and Japan tumbled on Friday, reversing gains from a rally the previous day, as investor anxiety about a potential investment bubble in artificial intelligence bled over to Asia from the United States.\n\nBenchmark indexes in South Korea and Taiwan fell nearly 4 percent in Asia on Friday. The losses were driven by declines in chip companies, including South Korea’s SK Hynix, which plummeted more than 8 percent. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company shed more than 4 percent.\n\nIn Japan, the Nikkei 225 index declined 2 percent. Advantest, a Japanese manufacturer of semiconductor equipment, was down more than 12 percent, while shares of SoftBank, a big investor in A.I. companies including OpenAI, sank almost 11 percent.\n\nIn recent weeks, investors have been increasingly concerned that tech companies’ lavish spending on A.I. hardware like semiconductors and data centers — which has helped to fuel a rally in A.I.-related stocks over the past three years — might be outpacing actual demand. That has prompted a slump in the shares of many large global technology firms.",
