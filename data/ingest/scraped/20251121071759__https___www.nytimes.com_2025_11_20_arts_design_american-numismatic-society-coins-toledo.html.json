  "title": "After 167 Years in New York, a Priceless Coin Collection Heads to Toledo",
  "text": "On the 11th floor of a downtown Manhattan building, just around the corner from the Holland Tunnel, sits one of the world’s finest collections of coins. Stored behind a series of locked doors in a massive, climate-controlled vault, the coins tell the story of civilization, from antiquity to today.\n\nA Sumerian clay tablet from about 2000 B.C.E. Early Chinese forms of money shaped like miniature tools. A silver French penny from the age of Charlemagne. A medal given by the Lincoln administration to a Native American chief, pierced by a bullet. More than 800,000 other telltale coins, medals and objects of wonder.\n\nBut apart from scholars, members and the occasional enthusiast, almost no one sees this treasure, which is one reason its guardian, the American Numismatic Society, is leaving the city where it was founded in the mid-19th century — and moving to Toledo, Ohio.",
