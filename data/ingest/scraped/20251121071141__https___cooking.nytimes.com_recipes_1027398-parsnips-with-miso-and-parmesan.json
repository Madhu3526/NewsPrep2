  "text": "Parsnips roast beautifully, their edges caramelizing as they soften and sweeten in the heat. Here, they’re paired with a quick miso-lemon dressing that provides sharp notes, bolstered by crisp golden garlic and thyme warmed in oil. A final layer of arugula and Parmesan, peppery, salty and bright, continues the contrast. What starts as a simple sheet-pan roast vegetable gets lifted until complete; depending on its company, it becomes the perfect side dish, or even a warm stand-alone salad.",
