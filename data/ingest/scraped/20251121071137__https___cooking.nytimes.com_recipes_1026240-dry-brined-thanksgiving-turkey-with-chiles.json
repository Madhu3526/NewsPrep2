  "text": "I totally second the finding that dry brining is the only way to go for a moist, flavorful turkey. I also second the idea of adding peppers to make the traditional flavor pop! I’ve been doing something similar to this for years. My dry brine, which goes onto my turkey on Monday, consists of salt, a bit of baking soda, lemon zest, black pepper, hot pepper (usually a combo of Birds Eye, dried Calabrian, and red pepper flake), thyme and sage. It imparts the heat and flavor, but keeps the general Thanksgiving theme. I don’t know about adding cumin, fennel, or mint. I wouldn’t want to overwhelm or make the flavors clash with my other dishes. My brine goes on all over the outside and inside the cavity, including under the skin in some places like the breast. I refresh the brine coating every day inside the cavity. I also add poblano peppers to the veggies (carrots, onions, celery) roasting on the bottom of the roaster rack and inside the bird, along with a dry apple cider. The peppers add a subtle smokiness to the subsequent gravy without changing the overall traditional Thanksgiving flavor theme.\n\nIs this helpful? 177",
