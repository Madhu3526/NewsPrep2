Stevie started out at Laptop Mag writing news and reviews on hardware, gaming, and AI.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nA few months after announcing its big name change, MSNBC is getting a new domain featuring its new name: ms.now. It features essentially the same layout as the old MSNBC website, but with a fresh coat of paint, including the new MS NOW flag logo — the old MSNBC peacock is gone.\n\nThe new website is launching as part of MS NOW’s independent newsroom, which began separating from NBC News in October. The split is the result of Comcast’s decision to spin off its cable channels, including MSNBC. With the new domain name and website refresh, MS NOW is leaving behind one of its clearest ties to NBC.\n\nMS.NOW on launch morning Screenshot: MS NOW\n\nMS NOW seems to have missed its opportunity to get msnow.com, which is currently occupied by a mostly empty page referencing “Motorized Snow vehicles.” Fortunately for them, domains with the .now extension went on sale about a year ago.\n\nIt’s somewhat ironic that MS NOW is keeping the “MS” part of its name, though, considering Microsoft sold its stake in the brand over 10 years ago. Of course, it no longer stands for Microsoft — now it’s “My Source for News, Opinion, and the World.”",
