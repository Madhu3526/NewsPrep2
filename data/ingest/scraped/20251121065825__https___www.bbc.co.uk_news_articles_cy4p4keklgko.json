  "title": "Soldier F trial: Prosecution spent more than £350k on barrister fees",
  "text": "The PPS said counsel costs to date are £362,552, including the judicial review and the five week trial at Belfast Crown Court.\n\nIt added some fees \"are yet to be processed\" but said the overall cost to the PPS could not be quantified.\n\n\"In the absence of detailed records of time spent on individual cases, it is not possible to produce precise costs, or even average costs for a particular type of case,\" the PPS said.\n\n\"This is because the amount of time required to take individual decisions as to prosecution (and for related administrative tasks) will vary depending upon a range of factors, including the complexity of the case.\"\n\nIt said its counsel fees are, however, \"identifiable\" costs.\n\nSoldier F, whose anonymity is protected by a court order, had been charged with murder and attempted murder in Londonderry on Bloody Sunday.\n\nThat day 13 people were shot dead and at least 15 others injured on 30 January 1972 at a civil rights demonstration in the Bogside area of the city.\n\nSoldier F was found not guilty at a trial in October.",
