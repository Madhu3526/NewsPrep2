  "text": "Step 4\n\nLower the oven to 325 degrees. Into a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, add the chilled potatoes and beat on medium for 3 minutes, scraping the sides of the bowl and beater as you go. Add the remaining ½ cup light brown sugar, 2 tablespoons butter and ½ teaspoon salt, along with the cinnamon, nutmeg and ginger. Beat on medium speed to combine for 2 to 3 minutes, again stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl and beater as you go. Reduce the speed to low and add the evaporated milk and vanilla, beating until combined. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating until fully incorporated, then turn the speed to medium-high and beat for another 45 seconds before pouring the mixture into the cooled crust. Set the pie on top of a baking sheet, then bake until set around the edges but just slightly jiggly in the center, 60 to 70 minutes.",
