  "title": "Sheet-Pan Coconut Curry With Squash and Tofu Recipe",
  "text": "In this warming sheet-pan dinner, winter squash receives the royal treatment, as it roasts in a (shallow!) coconut curry. Choosing a thin-skinned winter squash such as red kuri, kabocha, delicata or butternut means that no peeling is necessary. (In fact, the skin helps the squash keep its structure while cooking.) The whole curry is cooked on one sheet pan: The squash is roasted first, then the tofu, greens and coconut milk are added for an easy, hands-off approach. All curry pastes will vary in saltiness and heat, so add according to your taste preference. If you wanted a bigger flavor punch, you could add some grated ginger and garlic to the coconut milk. The leafy greens will crisp up around the edges, bringing a lovely textural contrast.",
