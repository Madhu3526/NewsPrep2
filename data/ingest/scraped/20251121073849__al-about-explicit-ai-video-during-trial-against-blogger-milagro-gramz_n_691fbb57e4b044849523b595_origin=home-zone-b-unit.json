  "text": "LOADING ERROR LOADING\n\nRapper Megan Thee Stallion broke down in tears while testifying about a sexually explicit deepfake video of her online.\n\nHer testimony came on Thursday at a federal courthouse in Miami for a defamation trial against a blogger known as Milagro Gramz, whose given name is Milagro Elizabeth Cooper.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMegan Thee Stallion, whose given name is Megan Pete, said in her defamation lawsuit against Cooper that the blogger orchestrated an extensive “campaign of harassment and cyberbullying” against her and promoted a deepfake pornographic video that used Pete’s face, according to a copy obtained by HuffPost.\n\nOn the stand, Pete said she still feels “defeated,” according to NBC News.\n\n“Because no matter what, no matter if the video was fake or not ... [Gramz] wanted it to be real,” Pete continued. “See, in a position like that, like, I know it’s not me, but to be in front of everybody else and they have to watch it — it’s really embarrassing.”\n\nCooper and other bloggers garnered attention during Canadian music artist Tory Lanez’s criminal trial in 2022. The trial centered around prosecutors’ claims that Lanez, whose given name is Daystar Peterson, shot Pete during a night out in 2020.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUltimately, a jury found Peterson guilty of assault with a semiautomatic firearm, having a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle and discharging a firearm with gross negligence. He was sentenced to 10 years.\n\nHowever, many bloggers spread false information that favored the now-convicted male artist and nurtured a barrage of “misogynoir” against Pete before, during and after the trial.\n\nEarlier this week, Cooper testified that Peterson did not influence or pay for her social media posts. However, she said that his father, Sonstar Peterson, paid her for “personal” reasons and “promotional” work, according to ABC News.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“It’s time to hold bloggers accountable for years of harassment, cyberbullying and the publication of misinformation about my personal and professional life,” Pete said in a statement when she filed her lawsuit against Cooper. “I’ve endured countless attacks on my character based on false narratives from social media bloggers misrepresenting themselves as journalists.\n\n“It’s unacceptable behavior and these individuals need to understand there will be repercussions for recklessly posting lies and defamatory falsehoods.”",
