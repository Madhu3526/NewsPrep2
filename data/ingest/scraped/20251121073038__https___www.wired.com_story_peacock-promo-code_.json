  "text": "Named after NBC’s iconic logo, Peacock is a video streaming service primarily featuring series and film content from NBC Universal studios, as well as news and sports programming. Premium tiers include a larger content library and access to additional NBC Sports, Hallmark Channel, and WWE content—yes, we’re talkin’ wrasslin.’ And right now, you can get access to all those programs with a Peacock Premium subscription. Save up to 50% on your first 12 months with the latest Peacock promo codes for Black Friday and subscription deals.\n\nWith over 30 million subscribers and various plans, Peacock has quickly grown to be a popular streaming service alongside titans like Netflix and Hulu. It even won out against competitors for Olympics and exclusive Paralympics coverage last summer. With original favorites like The Office, Poker Face, and Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and popular films like Oppenheimer and Jaws (as the film hits its 50th anniversary), there’s something for everyone in the family on Peacock TV. Check out our Peacock coupons, along with other great ways to save while streaming your faves.\n\nSave up to $80 With Today’s Peacock Promo Codes and Subscription Deals\n\nAs someone with approximately 792 subscriptions, it can be hard to know just how much I’m paying for each (not to mention how much total I’m spending a month) and which exactly has the content I want to watch most. Peacock also knows that most people use several streaming services and that it’s important to choose the ones that fit best with your budget and needs. Coming in clutch when you're still in “stay-inside-and-keep-warm” mode, Peacock is offering one full year of Peacock streaming for only $30. You can watch shows new to Peacock like Yellowstone Season 5 Part 2, The Traitors, and Conclave (and so much more) for even less.\n\nOne of the best ways to save on Peacock streaming is through annual plan discounts (versus monthly). Right now, when you pay for 10 months, you’ll get 2 months of Peacock Premium free. That comes out to be $80 annually, meaning you’ll get 12 months for the price of 10. You’ll save 16% on a Premium yearly plan, for only $9 per month—otherwise it’s $11 when paid monthly. There’s also Premium Plus, which has no ads, the ability to download and watch certain titles while offline, and includes your local NBC channel live, 24/7. This subscription tier is $17 per month, or $14 when paid annually.\n\nStudent, Military Members, and Teachers Get $7 Off Peacock\n\nTo unlock more discounts on a Peacock subscription, check if you qualify for their exclusive offers dedicated to students, teachers, and military members, medical workers, and other first responders. Eligible college students and young adults 18 to 24 can get 12 months of Peacock Premium at $3 a month (instead of the current rate of $11 per month). If you want Peacock for the whole family, you can even stream on 3 devices at once and even create up to 6 profiles with kid-safety settings. Peacock also has discounts for military members and teachers – verify your status, and get 12 months of Peacock Premium for $4 per month.\n\nSave up to 40% With Peacock Apple TV+ and Xfinity Bundle Deals\n\nIf it feels like you’re paying for approximately 403 streaming services, Peacock has reduced that number by one, at least. Now, you can bundle Xfinity and Peacock and save 40% on all of your favorite media content for $15 per month. You can get Peacock, Apple TV+, and Netflix when you add StreamSaver with Xfinity Internet. Prices vary based on which you choose: Netflix with ads is $8 per month, Peacock Premium with ads is $8 per month, and the Peacock Apple TV+ bundle is $15 per month.\n\nThere’s also Xfinity NOW StreamSaver Bundle—for $30 per month, this Xfinity internet bundle includes NOW TV, which has over 125 live channels and on-demand programming, Netflix with ads, Apple TV+, and Peacock Premium with ads. New or existing Xfinity Internet customers who subscribe to Gigabit or higher speed service can get two years of Peacock Premium for free, to boot! Along with the above deals, you can get Peacock Premium at no additional cost for Diamond or Platinum tier Xfinity Rewards members with any level of Xfinity Internet. To redeem, just login to your Xfinity Rewards account, click on the \"Get Peacock Premium at no extra cost\" reward, choose \"Get This Reward\", and follow the provided steps. You'll get an email with instructions to activate your offer.\n\nWatch Your Favorites and New Peacock TV Releases This Month\n\nThere is a wide breadth of new content coming to Peacock in November, including the cult favorite Peacock original adaptation of the classic original, Bel-Air, for Season 4. Plus, the first six films of the classic Jurassic saga are already streaming on Peacock, making this the perfect time to catch up before the new installment, Rebirth, comes out.\n\nOne of the best things to do during the holiday season is to put on a nostalgic movie that is good for the whole family, like the Harry Potter series. On Peacock, you can binge the entire Harry Potter saga in the background while dozing off and sneaking into the kitchen for seconds (or thirds).\n\nIf you’re like me and love to just absolutely turn your brain off (I’m talking no neuron flare ups would be detected in an MRI) and watch reality TV, let me introduce you to the wonderful world of Love Island. If you love watching Instagram models go from room to room to pool to gym and back again in a long-form version of a game of Telephone, this is the show for you. The great part is that every episode is about an hour long and there are approximately 4,200 episodes per season.",
