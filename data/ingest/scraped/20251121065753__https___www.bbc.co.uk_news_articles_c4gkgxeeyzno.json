  "text": "The residents of Peckham in south London have just lost their Poundland store, which closed this week after 11 years of trading.\n\n\"Everyone comes in here, it's very cheap. I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries,\" says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. \"It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?\"\n\nThe store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis.\n\nInstead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street.",
