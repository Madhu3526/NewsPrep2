  "text": "Quick, easy, delicious. For veggies I used radishes, cucumbers, shredded cabbage and cilantro, along with some shelled edamame beans I cooked with the noodles. The recipe calls for 2 tablespoons of ponzu per portion but this would have been too salty for us; I’d suggest starting with 1 tbsp per portion and letting people add more to taste. The adults also added some chili crisp to their bowls!\n\nIs this helpful?",
