  "text": "Tracking the curious history of a Russian ‘Shadow Fleet’ ship\n\nNed Davies\n\nBBC Verify analyst\n\nWhen a colleague reporting from the Baltic Sea with the Estonian navy asked me to help investigate a ship accused of being in Russia’s “shadow fleet”, I knew it would be a challenge to pin down its identity and history.\n\nAs my previous reporting on Russia-linked ships shows, vessels can broadcast false identification numbers and often change their name and flag.\n\nSifting through the International Maritime Organization (IMO)’s database, I confirmed that the ship in question, Unity, has had five different names and has been flagged to at five different countries in as many years.\n\nThe ship's tracking data shows it travelled between Russia’s Baltic ports and India, a common route for ships selling Russian oil.\n\nAlthough it was only sanctioned by the UK and EU in January, I found that some of its previous owners had also been sanctioned, which was often followed by a change of owner.\n\nIts current owner is a Dubai listed company, which is not sanctioned. According to the IMO the Unity is this firm’s only ship.\n\nOnce I had a clear idea of the vessel’s identity, reports revealed its chequered history. Under a previous name, Ocean Explorer, it had been caught in drone footage during an apparent ship-to-ship transfer with a vessel sanctioned by the UN for supplying oil to North Korea.\n\nRead more about the potential dangers posed by these vessels in our full piece here.",
