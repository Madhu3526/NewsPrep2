  "text": "Step 2\n\nPlace the turkey, breast-side up, on a wire rack set inside a large rimmed baking sheet and pat very dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the salt mixture all over the turkey, including inside the cavity, patting to adhere and nudging some into the crevices. You might not need all of the dry brine, but it’s good to have extra since some of it will end up on the baking sheet. Refrigerate the turkey, uncovered, for at least 12 hours and up to 2 days. (This deeply seasons the bird and dries the skin for better browning.)",
