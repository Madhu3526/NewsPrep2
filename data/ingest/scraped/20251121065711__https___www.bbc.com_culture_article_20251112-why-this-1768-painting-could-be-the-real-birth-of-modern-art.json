  "title": "'A tipping point'?: Why this 1768 painting could be the real birth of modern art",
  "text": "While many argue that \"modern art\" began in the 1800s, could it actually have started with Joseph Wright of Derby's An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump, nearly a century before?\n\nWhat is \"modern art\"? It seems like a simple question, but critics and art historians have quarrelled about it for decades without agreement. Nor is there any consensus about which artwork marks the turning point between \"traditional\" and \"modern\".\n\nMany point to the 1800s – and paintings like Le Déjeuner sur l'Herbe (1863) by Édouard Manet, Rain, Steam, and Speed - The Great Western Railway (1844) by JMW Turner, and The Third of May 1808 (1814) by Francisco Goya, who was described by the art critic Robert Hughes as \"the first modern artist and the last old master\".\n\nA new exhibition at the National Gallery in London reminds us that there is another contender in the ring. It's a painting that has some of the key ingredients of modern art, decades ahead of its time: Joseph Wright of Derby's An Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (1768).",
