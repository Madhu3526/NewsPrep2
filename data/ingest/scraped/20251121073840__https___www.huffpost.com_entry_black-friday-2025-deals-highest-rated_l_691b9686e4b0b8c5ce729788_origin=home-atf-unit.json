It's a compact, handheld tool about as long as a fork that turns nearly any water safe for drinking.\n\nSurvivalist Ky Furneaux first recommended it to HuffPost, saying that anyone venturing outside should keep one handy as a precaution. “It’s light and doesn’t take up much room so it isn’t a huge inconvenience for something that may save your life,” she said, adding that “just knowing that water purification is taken care of takes a load off your mind and allows you to fully focus on other needs.”\n\n“It can remove microplastics, bacteria, parasites and more (including E. coli, salmonella and giardia) from just about any water source,\" Lourdes Uribe wrote in our previous coverage. \"One single filter has a long lifespan, providing about 1,000 gallons of clean and safe drinking water — making it well worth the price tag.”\n\n\n\nWhile this is an easy “yes” for hikers and campers navigating water sources in the great outdoors, Uribe notes it can be a smart purchase for travelers and city slickers alike. \"Even if you’re not big on the great outdoors, there’s no denying that there’s enough global instability to make one a bit nervous — and the existence of natural disasters alone is a good enough reason to have one in an emergency kit,\" she said. Over 120,000 Amazon reviewers have helped the product earn a rare 4.8-star rating.",
