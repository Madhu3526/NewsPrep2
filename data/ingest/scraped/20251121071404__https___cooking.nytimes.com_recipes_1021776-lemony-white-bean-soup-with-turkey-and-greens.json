  "text": "You never need to be without that pesky \"1 Tbsp. of tomato paste.\" Open a can at both ends and remove the lid from one end. Using the other lid, push out approximately a tablespoonful of paste, slice it off and lay it on a sheet of waxed paper on a small cutting board or flat tray; repeat until you've used it all. Place the rounds of paste in the freezer and, when frozen solid, store in a zipper bag with the air sucked out. Voila, small portions of tomato paste on demand.\n\nIs this helpful? 4847",
