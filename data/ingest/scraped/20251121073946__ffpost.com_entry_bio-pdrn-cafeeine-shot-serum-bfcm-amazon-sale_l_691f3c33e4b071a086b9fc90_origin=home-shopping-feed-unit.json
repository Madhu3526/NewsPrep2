  "text": "“The IOPE BIO-PDRN Caffeine Shot Serum is a total game-changer for my skin! The high 38% BIO-PDRN helps boost skin repair and elasticity, while the caffeine works to depuff and brighten my complexion. My skin feels firmer, smoother, and looks more awake almost like I’ve had a full night’s rest. The texture is lightweight and absorbs quickly, leaving no stickiness, just a healthy, rejuvenated glow. It’s perfect for mornings when I need that extra boost of radiance.” — Amberlisse\n\n“I’ve been using this serum for a few weeks, and I can honestly say it feels like a mini spa treatment in a bottle. The texture is silky and absorbs quickly without feeling sticky, which I really appreciate.” — Linda\n\n“I love this PDRN by IOPE. I have been using this for over a year now, and I love the fact that this Bio-PDRN is powered by plants instead of salmon, making it vegan. There is no scent and it does not leave a sticky residue on my skin. I am 54 and it helps with dryness caused by aging. My skin soaks this serum up and I will continue purchasing.” — amy currie",
