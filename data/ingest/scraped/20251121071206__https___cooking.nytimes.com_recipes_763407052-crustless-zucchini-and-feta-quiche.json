  "title": "Crustless Zucchini and Feta Quiche Recipe",
  "text": "A low-effort crustless quiche can be adapted to the seasons, as perfect for weeknight dinner as it is for weekend brunch. This one is flecked with zucchini, salty cheese and fragrant scallions, and though it feels sunny and summery, it can be prepared year-round. Grating the zucchini is key to achieving the supple texture, allowing the liquid to be easily squeezed out while retaining just enough moisture to keep the egg base light and silky, with an irresistible custard-like consistency. Like French clafoutis, this crustless quiche has a touch of flour, which stabilizes the custard and delivers a firm-yet-jiggly texture. Feta’s sharp tang enlivens zucchini’s mellow earthiness, while Cheddar, preferably aged, brings essential saltiness. Serve this dish warm or at room temperature, alone or with a side salad.",
