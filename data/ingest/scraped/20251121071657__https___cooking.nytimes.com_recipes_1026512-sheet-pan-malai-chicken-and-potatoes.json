  "title": "Sheet-Pan Malai Chicken and Potatoes Recipe",
  "text": "Inspired by traditional South Asian malai chicken, a warmly spiced, yogurt-marinated dish that’s usually tandoor-grilled or served as a creamy curry, this sheet-pan meal comes together in under an hour. Here, the cream, or malai, is added just before serving, combining with lemon juice and water to create a silky, tangy sauce. The yogurt marinade acts as a powerful tenderizer for the chicken, so even a quick rest will enhance the flavors (if you have time for an overnight marinade, all the better). For this version, a sheet pan is used to maximize surface area and help the potatoes brown, but a cast-iron skillet also works.",
