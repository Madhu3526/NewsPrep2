Nought 16, two and a half seconds.\n\n800 horsepower.\n\nThis thing is a hyper car for the waves.\n\nCut to me screaming.\n\n[host screams]\n\nWarp speed!\n\nOh my Lord!\n\nIt's like light bending around you!\n\n[classical music continues]\n\nBlimey! Oh-ho!\n\nShadow Six. The company that makes crazy vehicles,\n\nincluding a super special new watercraft,\n\nunlike anything you've seen before.\n\nLet's go inside,\n\nand meet the people that make these monster machines.\n\nHey.\n\nNice to meet you. Nice to meet you.\n\nNice to meet you.\n\nTell us a little bit about\n\nwhat Shadow Six actually is.\n\nShadow Six essentially started out\n\nwhere I was developing the original Typhoon for myself\n\nand very quickly realized lots\n\nof other people were interested\n\nand that led into quite a few other inventions\n\nand vehicles that we've developed for other individuals\n\nthat have bad ideas like myself.\n\nLet's take a look at some of those. Shall we?\n\nYeah. Let's do it.\n\nShow me a few that you've got here.\n\nYou got it.\n\n[Jeremy] Start with this one.\n\n[Ryan] Yeah. What's this?\n\nSo this is an autonomous cooler that somebody can ride on\n\nor you can actually use an app\n\nand it knows what beverages are inside.\n\nIt's got full surround sound, through wet sounds.\n\nIt's a floating cooler. It is.\n\nWith propellers.\n\nIt is, yeah.\n\nI recognize this. Is it a Ninebot?\n\nIt is. Yeah.\n\nSo we put tank treads on the back\n\nand we put air inflated tires on the front\n\nand now it's able to climb over all kinds of things\n\nthat it wasn't, and it's able to get in the sand and go\n\nand it's able to to travel through the yard\n\nand travel through grass without any problem.\n\nIt all started with the Typhoon, didn't it?\n\nThat's what, that's the...\n\nAnd you know, can we get a shot of these?\n\n'cause these are the...\n\nAre these are these the original drawings?\n\n[Ryan] They are.\n\n[Jeremy] Are they your drawings?\n\n[Ryan] They are.\n\n[Jeremy] What were you thinking\n\nwhen you came up with that? [laughs]\n\nYeah. I was about two, three months out\n\nfrom my son's third birthday\n\nand I asked him what he wanted to do for his birthday\n\nand he told me he wanted to go\n\nto Las Vegas for a guy's trip.\n\nAnd then he explained to me\n\nthat the Monster Jam World finals were there.\n\nHe saw a billboard on the way home\n\nand it said Polaris Adventure,\n\nwhere you basically drive a Razor\n\n[Jeremy] On the dunes.\n\nYeah, out in the dunes.\n\nHe absolutely loved it.\n\nAnd that kind of got me intrigued in the idea\n\nof side by sides, and the suspension.\n\nFast forward about two months later,\n\nI went to The Bahamas with my wife.\n\nWe went out and rode a WaveRunner\n\nand I kind of had this epiphany\n\nthat combining the two together\n\nwould really make for a fun toy.\n\nSo right at that moment you thought, hang on a minute.\n\nIf I put two wave riders underneath the body\n\nof a side by side, I could be on to something.\n\nExactly.\n\nNow that we know the genesis of the idea,\n\nwhere it came from, I'm dying to see it.\n\nCome on. You got it.\n\nLet's see it. Come on.\n\nYeah, absolutely. Let's go.\n\n[soft dramatic music]\n\nHere it is.\n\nWhat do you think?\n\nIt's big. [laughs]\n\n[Ryan] It is.\n\n[host laughs]\n\nI've seen it on screen,\n\nbut it doesn't quite prepare you\n\nfor seeing it in the metal, as it were.\n\nYeah.\n\nLike it's crazy.\n\nNow the typhoon may be big,\n\nbut is it desirable?\n\nAnd that's what we are here to find out.\n\nWhat Shadow Six has built does not fit\n\ninto the usual realm of luxury gear.\n\nThere's no bling here, no collaboration with Hermes\n\nor Ferrari.\n\nWhat the typhoon does have in spades though is exclusivity.\n\nOnly Shadow Six makes it and it's so far ahead\n\nof anything else you might try and compare it to,\n\nit simply blows all competition outta the water.\n\nTell us a bit about these, what power have they got?\n\nWhy are they so long?\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, what's going on here?\n\nThe hulls ultimately are, size-wise,\n\ndictated by keeping the shape of a triangle.\n\nWhat that does is it gives you the strongest shape\n\nin the world, but ultimately takes all the force\n\nthat would typically be exerted on the bottom of the hull\n\nand sends it up through the suspension\n\nand in through the cage on top of the chassis.\n\nSo inside here,\n\nthis isn't an electric vehicle, is it?\n\nThis is not.\n\nWhat've we got inside?\n\nWe've got two Yamaha, 1.8 liter GP 1800 RSVHL engines,\n\nand each one of these engines\n\nputs out a little under 400 horsepower.\n\nSo a total of 800. Yeah.\n\nAnd they're tuned. Are they?\n\nAnd they're tuned. Yep, they are. Yep.\n\nOkay. As we go around, obviously the things\n\nthat you cannot get away from is this significant cage\n\nthat you've got all the way around this.\n\nNow this, is this titanium?\n\n[Ryan] It's all titanium, yeah.\n\nOkay. And that's for weight of course.\n\nSo strength, weight,\n\nand also because of the molecular bond structure,\n\nit's very similar to aluminum\n\nin that it's a four-way bond\n\nand because of that it's non-magnetic\n\nand it won't corrode in the ocean.\n\nYou know, you're looking at exerting\n\nsomewhere near 20,000 pounds of static load on any one\n\nof these four corners at any given time.\n\nThe roll cage up top, is that for protection\n\nof the passengers inside the drive in the passenger?\n\nIt's not. It's actually there for structural rigidity.\n\nSo without that cage, because all of the energy from waves\n\nand jumping the vehicle,\n\ngets sent up through the suspension,\n\nit would cause the chassis to crumple on itself\n\nwithout having the upper portion of the cage.\n\nWow.\n\nHow does the suspension actually work?\n\nThe suspension itself is what's actually articulating.\n\nIn the front,\n\nthe suspension holds both of the hulls identically parallel\n\nthrough the full range of motion.\n\nAnd in the rear, you've got a series of joints\n\nand bearings that allow the rear suspension\n\nto actually travel out and up\n\nand then return to center,\n\nonce the vehicle's back on the water.\n\nHave you taken the suspension from anything else\n\nor have you come up with this?\n\nNope. It's entirely proprietary.\n\nIs it patented? It is.\n\nI think we've got around 30 patents now, 30 plus,\n\nbetween all the different aspects of the vehicles.\n\nThat's crazy.\n\nImpressive as it is,\n\nyou clearly can't do all this on your own.\n\nWho have you been working with?\n\nYou've got some guys here.\n\nYeah, so I've got two of our head fabricators here.\n\nWilson is in charge of all of our composites\n\nand carbon fiber and fiberglass.\n\nAnd then we've got Mike.\n\nHey.\n\nAnd it was an awful lot of fabrication.\n\nWell, I've got a million questions really,\n\nbut let's start with, it doesn't need the roll cage\n\nin order to protect the passengers.\n\nBut how does, I can't...\n\nCan I tip this over if I really tried?\n\nI don't think so,\n\n'cause all the weight is in the bottom.\n\nThe weight is all in the...so.\n\nWell hang on a minute.\n\nMost of it, it looks like most of the weight is up here.\n\nLooks like most of the weight's up there,\n\nbut all the weight is below the water line\n\nwith their four cylinder engine.\n\nSo it's like the engine of a small car.\n\nSo it's pretty heavy.\n\nThe titanium chassis weighs 143 pounds.\n\nAnd what's below the water line?\n\nBelow the water, each jet ski is around like 900 pounds.\n\n[Jeremy] Oh, I see. So like around 80%\n\nof the total vehicle's weight is here.\n\nIt's below the water.\n\n[Mike] It's below the water.\n\nAnd that's why it doesn't tip over?\n\nThat's why it won't tip over. Right.\n\nHere's a sample of titanium.\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nSo the entire chassis is made of that.\n\nThat, it weighs...That weighs virtually nothing.\n\nSo it's stronger than steel. Lighter than steel\n\nWon't corrode And it won't corrode.\n\nThat's the main thing, is it won't corrode\n\nWith such a bespoke architecture, it's no surprise\n\nthat each Typhoon takes nearly 1000 hours to build,\n\nwhich is why you'll have\n\nto part with a quarter of a million dollars to own one.\n\nAnd that's more than a Ferrari Roma\n\nor an Aston Martin DB 12 coupe.\n\nAnd Ryan, this isn't pocket change,\n\nthis is a seriously high-end vehicle.\n\nSo who are you selling them to?\n\nProbably the lowest net worth I can imagine\n\nof anybody who's really reached out\n\nand wanted to purchase a vehicle is in excess\n\nof a hundred million dollars in net worth.\n\nSo the customer that has the least money\n\nthat's bought one of these\n\nis worth a hundred million dollars?\n\nExactly.\n\nAnd it goes up from there?\n\nAnd it goes up from there.\n\nOkay. So royalty?\n\nSome, yeah, as a matter of fact, yeah.\n\n[host laughs]\n\nOkay. I've got two more questions.\n\nDid you even consider though,\n\nmaking this electric rather than TCE?\n\nYeah, it's definitely something we're extremely\n\ninterested in as a company.\n\nThe reality of it is, is that electrification is very heavy\n\nand doesn't really offer the performance\n\nthat we're getting out of a traditional combustion engine.\n\nNot yet anyway. Not yet at least.\n\nAnd so I think as hydrogen fuel cells come online\n\nand become more available,\n\nwe'll slowly progress into looking at electrification\n\nof these vehicles.\n\nBut what was happened in making the typhoon\n\nthat you just thought,\n\nI've never thought that was going to be the case?\n\nOne of the most shocking things ultimately came\n\nfrom the adjustments in the suspension\n\nand finding that setting suspension up\n\nfor salt water was different\n\nthan setting it up for the fresh water.\n\nAnd that's all based on the buoyancy of the water itself.\n\nYou're gonna get a little bit more\n\nof a stiff ride in the ocean\n\nbecause of the additional buoyancy.\n\nAnd so we wanna set it a little softer in salt water\n\nthan we do in fresh water.\n\nAnd you know, that gives you a little bit better response\n\nin terms of getting into turns and cornering at high speeds.\n\nHow many of these are in the wild right now?\n\nSo there were nine pre-production units,\n\nand we kept one of the vehicles, which we're looking at now,\n\nwhich was the final pre-production unit.\n\nSo there's eight out there in the world?\n\n[Ryan] There are. That's it.\n\nAnd we get to drive this one?\n\nYep, we get to drive this one.\n\nI've gotta have a go.\n\n[dramatic classical music]\n\nOkay. If the Typhoon is good enough for actual royalty,\n\nit's good enough for Wired.\n\nBut to be honest, I was nervous\n\nabout getting in this crazy watercraft.\n\nSomething Ryan is calling\n\nthe world's first aquatic utility vehicle.\n\nI've been in supercars\n\nthat could do nought to sixty in two\n\nand a half seconds and that's petrifying enough on a runway.\n\nDoing those speeds on water in something that looks\n\nlike it's driven off a sand dune seems like madness.\n\nAnd more than a little dangerous.\n\nI've been in fancy cars with worse seats than these.\n\nThis is great.\n\nAh, so this is the wearable.\n\nYep.\n\nSo it's a dead man switch, isn't it?\n\nYep.\n\nSo it's if you go out,\n\nthen if it's not in the proximity of the vehicle,\n\nthe vehicle stops.\n\nYep. But it's also a GPS tracker.\n\nYou got it. Exactly.\n\nAnd same thing with the brain inside of the actual vessel.\n\nSo it'll tell the coast guard both where you are\n\nand where you've drifted and what the currents are like\n\nas well as where the machine is.\n\n[Typhoon engine revs]\n\nI think we should play this.\n\nWhoa!\n\n[Typhoon engine revs]\n\n[Jeremy exclaims]\n\nBlimey!\n\nWhoa!\n\nHow can you see?\n\nHow can you see in this thing? [laughs]\n\nThis is the impressive bit,\n\nhow when you're turning, it's crazy.\n\n[Ryan] It's stable, yep.\n\nIt stays perfectly level\n\nand everything actually works on it.\n\n[Jeremy] Whoa! Geez!\n\nBlimey!\n\nAnd how is it stopping?\n\nSo all gotta do is pull up the throttle\n\nand then, you know, essentially\n\nwhat's happening is it's coming out of the water.\n\nSo what you feel is the thing going back down\n\nand laying back in the water again.\n\nSo is it just the friction of the water stopping you?\n\nJust the water stopping you, yep.\n\nSo it feels like you're putting brakes on.\n\nNope, that's no brake.\n\nNo?\n\nA brake will stop it way faster.\n\nWhich, you probably don't want to use it. I mean...\n\nNo.\n\nWarp speed!\n\nHell!\n\nJesus Christ!\n\n[dramatic classical music]\n\n[Jeremy whoops]\n\nOh geez.\n\nOh my god.\n\n[Ryan] That guy's still fishing. Yeah.\n\nOh geez! Oh my God!\n\nIt's like light bending around you!\n\n[Jeremy exclaims]\n\nAlright. Okay. I'm just, yeah, I'm just going to...\n\nI'm just gonna have a bit of dry land.\n\n[Ryan laughs] Just for a sec.\n\nIt really is a feat of engineering.\n\n[Ryan] Yeah.\n\nAnd like, and as I said,\n\nand you know, you guys have done it all.\n\nNo one's done this before.\n\nAll these patents, you've sorted it all out yourself\n\nand it genuinely delivers on what you actually say.\n\nAnd I know you're prepared for the speed,\n\nbut you're not, you're not really,\n\nYeah, no, nothing can really prepare you for it.\n\nJust nothing else is like it, in my opinion.\n\nSo you ready to give it a try?\n\nI am actually ready to give it a try. [chuckles]\n\nBut what I'd like to do is that,\n\nthat's an electric jet ski in your shop.\n\nCould we actually race the two?\n\nI wanna see how electric does against this.\n\n[Ryan] You got it.\n\n[Jeremy] I've always been Team Electric\n\nwhen it comes to Wired's vehicles\n\nand I revel in telling petrolheads\n\nhow EV acceleration leaves combustion cars in the dust.\n\nSo when I saw the Stealth Evo in Ryan's workshop,\n\nI just had to see how it would hold up\n\nagainst the Typhoon's fearsome powertrain.\n\nIt didn't go well.\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nA hypercar for the water, so they say.\n\nWhat the hell am I doing?\n\nAlright, they're ready.\n\nI don't know that I'm gonna win\n\neven with a rolling start, so.\n\n3, 2. 2, 1.\n\nGo!\n\n[dramatic music continues]\n\n[Jeremy] Oh my god!\n\n[Jeremy yells inaudibly]\n\n[Birds sing]\n\n[dramatic music]\n\nAnd again! And again!\n\n[engines rev]\n\nOh fucking hell!\n\nGlued to the water.\n\nGlued to the water.\n\n[Director] Hi Jeremy, can you hear me?\n\nI can, I can.\n\nWell, electric didn't win that one.\n\nI can hear you, yeah.\n\n[Director] I think you won that one.\n\n[birds sing]\n\n[Jeremy] So we've come to the end of our day\n\nwith the astonishing Typhoon.\n\nI've really never experienced anything like it.\n\nIt's one of a kind,\n\nwell actually, it's eight or nine of a kind,\n\nand that's the only ones that exist.\n\nAnd it's all come from one guy's head.\n\nAnd he was told so many times that he couldn't make it\n\nand his team couldn't make it.\n\nAnd every time they fixed one problem,\n\neveryone else told them,\n\nNo, you can't do it, you can't do it.\n\nThey end up with a machine\n\nthat the super wealthy are clamoring to get their hands on.\n\nThey're buying it before they can even try it.\n\nAnd he's selling them at $250,000 a pop.\n\nIt's a hell of an achievement.\n\nBut above all, it's realizing this vision that he had\n\nfor this sort of Baja truck on the water,\n\npatented up to the eyeballs, it's a real amazing thing.\n\nNow we need to start introducing some sort\n\nof desirability index into the Wired Desired.\n\nAnd this is incredibly desirable.\n\nYou know, it's right up there.\n\nEight maybe? You know, like, you probably don't want it,\n\nif you haven't got loads of money, it's expensive.\n\nAnd also if you don't live on the water\n\nlike they do here down in Florida.\n\nBut if you do have these circumstances, my God.\n\nIn fact, I'm gonna have to have one last go.\n\n[dramatic classical music]",
