  "text": "Between deadlines, school runs and the constant \"what's for dinner?\" chat, even the best relationships can start running on autopilot.\n\nIt doesn't mean the spark has gone or that you've stopped loving your partner, but rather that life has got in the way.\n\nWriter Nell Frizzell knows this all too well - after 10 years with her partner and two young children, she admits she doesn't have as much time or energy for her husband as she once did.\n\n\"I know we're told to focus on quality time, physical touch and gaze into each other's eyes lovingly but actually I am shouting at my husband to turn the eggs off.\"\n\nFrizzell says she's at a \"crunch point\" in her life.\n\nHer time, body and attention are being pulled in every direction - she's raising children, caring for elderly parents, running the home and working all at the same time.\n\n\"And within all of that, where do you have the time to look into someone's eyes and say you're wonderful?\" she asks.",
