  "text": "Girls' parents said she was 'happy' at the primary school\n\nEimear Flanagan\n\nBBC News NI\n\nThe parents of the girl at the centre of this case are not Christians and are “broadly speaking” humanist in their outlook on life, according to the judgement.\n\nThe girl, who is now 11, went to the school for three academic years, when she was between four and seven years of age.\n\nHer parents agreed that during her time at the school she was \"happy\" and the principal described the child as \"a much-valued pupil”.\n\nThe judgement stated that the parents were \"at pains to point out that they have no issue with the school other than the provision of religious education and collective worship\".\n\nTheir concern stemmed from their fear that school was teaching their child to assume that Christianity was \"an absolute truth\".\n\nThe parents did not want their daughter to be raised as a Christian, but instead wanted to bring her up to be \"caring, ethical, and respectful towards all people, whatever their religious beliefs or otherwise\".\n\nThe family also insisted that they do not object to the teaching of religion in general, provided that such education was objective, critical, pluralistic and age-appropriate.\n\nThe judgement explained that the family's concerns were \"heightened given that she is being taught at an age prior to the development of her critical faculties\".",
