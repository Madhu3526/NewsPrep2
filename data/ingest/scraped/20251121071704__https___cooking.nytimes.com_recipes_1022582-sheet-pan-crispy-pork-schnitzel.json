  "text": "This is a terrific technique. I find that NYT recipes often look under seasoned to me. I followed a tip and used hot smoked paprika and was happy. Spice it up however you think it should be done. I used a pork loin that I sliced into disks and lightly flattened. Some I did a single panko dip. Some I doubled up to use up the egg and crumbs. My little disks were about 1/4 thick. Very high quality local farmed pork. 8-9 minutes in the air fryer. (Two batches). WOW. Super crunchy. Meat soft as butter. Will make great Katsu style Sammie’s. I liked both the double and single dipped. The salad scared me a little cause capers and hearts of palm are “weird”. Made it exact to recipe. It really is a perfect foil to the pork. The pork is so crunchy that I thought I could probably skip the celery. But with any other dish the celery is a nice crunch to the soft hearts. I will think of other salads to use the dressing on. It was fabulous.\n\nIs this helpful?",
