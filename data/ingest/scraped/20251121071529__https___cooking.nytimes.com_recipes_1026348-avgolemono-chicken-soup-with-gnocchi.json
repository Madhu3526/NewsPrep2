  "text": "I am a classically trained chef and I often find the amount of time NYT allots for their recipes to be often comically conservative. This was truly put together in under half an hour and has the taste of something that took hours to prepare. A quick, one pot, truly simple weeknight dinner that is comforting and light. Some notes: bone broth, even from the carton, takes this recipe from tasty to heavenly. The additional collagen in the broth gives this soup a velvety smooth texture. Splurge on your eggs. I mean you should always splurge on your eggs but the more orange the yolk, the better results you will have. I “1.5” this recipe. 2 quarts of bone broth plus a quart of stock or hot water with chicken base equivalent. Up the chicken base in lieu of salt. Kroger has a gnocchi with Parmesan in it, 2lbs of that. 1 cup of lemon juice, 7 garlic cloves, 7 yolks. Use a smaller ladle to temper broth into eggs— it will help keep you from going too fast. Don’t stop whisking. Costco sells pre pulled rotisserie meat which works great in this. I find dark meat to be too much for this dish. Increase to a rolling boil just before addition of gnocchi, cook for about 90 seconds and then remove from heat. Add egg mixture and let sit for a few minutes before serving. This will prevent the gnocchi and the egg from overcooking. To reheat, do so on the stove. Slowly. Just until warm. Microwaving will fry the homogenous mixture and turn the gnocchi to mashed potatoes.\n\nIs this helpful?",
