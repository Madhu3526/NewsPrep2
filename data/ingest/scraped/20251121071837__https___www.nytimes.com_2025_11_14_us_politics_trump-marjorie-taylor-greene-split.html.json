  "title": "Trump Cuts Ties With Marjorie Taylor Greene, Calling Her ‘Wacky’",
  "text": "President Trump is done with Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nOnce one of Mr. Trump’s most reliable allies on Capitol Hill, the Georgia Republican has increasingly broken ranks with him, most notably by calling for the release of the Justice Department’s files about the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nBy Friday evening, Mr. Trump let the world know how he felt.\n\n“I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of ‘Congresswoman’ Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the Great State of Georgia,” he wrote on social media. Over the past several weeks, Mr. Trump said, “all I see ‘Wacky’ Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!”\n\nIn a barrage of posts that continued into the weekend, the president characterized Ms. Greene — whom he stood by when she was under fire, years ago, for voicing conspiracy theories about the Sept. 11 attacks, school shootings and wildfires started by space lasers — as a “disgrace,” a “traitor” and a nuisance who was interrupting his life.\n\n“She has told many people that she is upset that I don’t return her phone calls anymore, but with 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day,” he said.",
