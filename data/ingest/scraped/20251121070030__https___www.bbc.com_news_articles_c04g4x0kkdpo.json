  "text": "Tributes to Stone Roses and Primal Scream bassist Mani\n\n11 hours ago Share Save Steven McIntosh, Entertainment reporter and Ian Youngs, Culture reporter Share Save\n\nGetty Images Gary 'Mani' Mounfield played on both Stone Roses albums and later joined Primal Scream\n\nGary \"Mani\" Mounfield, bassist with legendary Manchester band the Stone Roses, has died at the age of 63. Mounfield's bass playing was an integral part of the Stone Roses' \"baggy\" sound, and later reunited with his bandmates for their comeback tour in 2012. He joined another seminal group, Primal Scream, in 1996 and played with them for 15 years. The musician's brother Greg announced his death \"with the heaviest of hearts\" in a post on Facebook. Oasis singer Liam Gallagher led the tributes, posting: \"In total shock and absolutely devastated on hearing the news about Mani. My hero, RIP R Kid.\"\n\nGetty Images Mani pictured on stage with Ian Brown in 2004\n\nThe Stone Roses posted on social media: \"RIP our wonderful brother Mani. The greatest bass player and friend we could ever have wished for. X\" Singer Ian Brown also paid his own tribute on X, writing: \"REST IN PEACE MANi X.\" Mounfield's wife Imelda died in November 2023, three years after she was diagnosed with bowel cancer. The couple have twin boys, who were born in 2013. Happy Mondays frontman Shaun Ryder posted: \"RIP Mani – my heartfelt condolences to his twin boys and all of his family.\" Ryder's Happy Mondays bandmate, vocalist Rowetta, posted a photo of herself with Mani and Imelda on X with the message: \"Going to miss you so much. All my love to the boys, the family & all those who knew & loved him.\"\n\nGetty Images Mani, bottom left, with John Squire, Ian Brown and Reni in the Stone Roses' heyday in 1990\n\nWith Mani on bass, Brown on vocals, John Squire on guitar and Alan \"Reni\" Wren on drums, the Stone Roses were at the forefront of the \"Madchester\" indie scene of the late 1980s and early 90s. Combining a melting pot of influences from across indie, punk, psychedelic rock, dance, funk and reggae, they released their beloved debut album in 1989. The self-titled LP featured such classic songs as I Wanna Be Adored, She Bangs The Drums and I Am The Resurrection, all underpinned by the grooves of Mani's basslines. It was named the greatest British album of all time by the Observer in 2004 and NME two years later. Its harder-rocking follow-up Second Coming came out in 1994. Both albums reached the top five in the UK. After the group disbanded in 1996, Mani joined Scottish rock band Primal Scream, first playing on their album Vanishing Point, released a year later, where his bass playing was a key part of krautrock-influenced lead single Kowalski.\n\nRoses reunion\n\nGetty Images The Stone Roses pictured in 2012, left to right: John Squire, Mani, Ian Brown and Reni\n\nMounfield would go on to record four more albums with Primal Scream before leaving in 2011 to reform The Stone Roses. The band released two further singles in 2016, but no full-length album followed and the group disbanded once more in 2017 after old tensions resurfaced. The Stone Roses played a number of UK gigs over 2016 and 2017 before their split, including a concert at Glasgow's Hampden Park, which would end up being the classic line-up's last concert. Brown told the crowd: \"Don't be sad that it's over, be happy that it happened.\"\n\n'One of the absolute best'\n\nLast month, Mani told the Rockonteurs podcast he was \"in a great space\" and was \"itching to get back\" on stage. The lead singer of The Charlatans, Tim Burgess, re-posted a picture of the pair together that he had originally shared last week, on Mani’s 63rd birthday. \"One of the absolute best in every way,\" Burgess wrote. \"Such a beautiful friend.\" Echo And The Bunnymen singer Ian McCulloch also posted a tribute on X, saying his \"thoughts and feelings\" went out to his family. \"I'm absolutely gutted to hear the news about Mani, who I have always loved and always will love, deeply and forever. Like a brother,\" McCulloch said. \"I am in shock to be honest.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nMani also had a guest role in the 2002 movie 24 Hour Party People and was in supergroup Freebass, with fellow bass players Andy Rourke of The Smiths and Peter Hook of Joy Division and New Order. Hook wrote on X: \"Oh God. Mani... words just fail me this time, they really do. I cannot believe it. Sending all my love to his family. This is so sad. RIP mate. Love Hooky. X\" The supergroup disbanded before releasing their debut album, It's A Beautiful Life, in 2010.\n\n'A rare person'",
