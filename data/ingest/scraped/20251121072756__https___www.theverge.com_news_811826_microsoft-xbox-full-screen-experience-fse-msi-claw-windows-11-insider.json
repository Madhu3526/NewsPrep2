  "text": "is a senior reporter covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nMicrosoft’s new Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE), which adds a console-like navigation experience to Windows PC gaming handhelds, is coming to another family of devices: the MSI Claw. As part of the latest Windows 11 Insider Preview Build, Microsoft is rolling out support for the Xbox FSE in preview to “MSI Claw models” today, the company announced.\n\nFSE debuted on the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X earlier this month, and my colleague Sean Hollister ran into quite a few issues with it (and the new handhelds). If you’re interested in installing the Xbox FSE on your MSI Claw, you might want to wait until some of the problems are ironed out and until it’s available outside of the Windows Insider program.\n\nTo turn on the Xbox FSE, “on supported devices, go to Settings > Gaming > Full screen experience, then select Xbox as your home app,” Microsoft says. “Once enabled, you can access FSE from Task View and Game Bar or configure your handheld to enter full screen experience on startup.”\n\nIn today’s post, Microsoft says that “additional OEMs” will be enabling their handhelds to use the Xbox FSE “in the coming months,” and we already know that Lenovo’s Legion Go 2 is set to get it next year.",
