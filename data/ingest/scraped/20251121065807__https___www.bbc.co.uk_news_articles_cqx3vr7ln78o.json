  "text": "Vashi continued trading for more than 10 months after Mr Ames's report to the SFO, as its owner Vashi Dominguez encouraged investors to pour millions of pounds into the business.\n\nAdvertising executive, Michael Moszynski, says he invested tens of thousands of pounds in December 2022, more than six months after the SFO had been warned about Vashi.\n\n\"Had the SFO done their job, I wouldn't have lost my money. I was astonished to see the lack of any follow up,\" he told the BBC.\n\nJohn Ames says he contacted the SFO a further time, in September this year, following Panorama's investigation into Vashi.\n\nMr Ames says the SFO apologised for the delay in responding to his initial referral saying in a video call it was because of \"an administrative error\" because of an update made to the whistleblower referral platform in 2024.\n\nHowever, Mr Ames told the SFO that he had made his report in 2022 - two years before this update to the platform.\n\nThe SFO told Panorama it investigates about 35 cases at any time and that they are the most complex economic crimes that specifically warrant its expertise and specialist powers.\n\n\"Fraud, bribery and corruption have a devastating impact on lives and livelihoods, and we are committed to tackling the most complex economic crimes to protect the public and our economy.\"\n\nIt said it could not reveal the details of its \"internal assessment process\".\n\nThe Insolvency Service said it opened an investigation in 2023, after the company had gone into liquidation.\n\n\"It revealed irregularities that we were unable to clarify due to the principal director leaving the country,\" said a spokesperson. \"We have shared our findings with law enforcement partners.\"",
