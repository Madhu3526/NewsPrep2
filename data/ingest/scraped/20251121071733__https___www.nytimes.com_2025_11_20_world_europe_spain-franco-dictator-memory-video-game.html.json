The ministry officials are exploring the possibility of the Franco-era escape room, in which a player would try to track down a friend active in pro-democracy movements “and get to him before the police do.” Then there was Kill Democracy, a game app for smartphones in which players try to undermine democracy by censoring journalists, manipulating the courts or jailing opponents. The point, she said, was to demonstrate the tenuous nature of freedom, though she allowed there was a risk that some might overlearn the lesson. She said she wondered at first, “Are we giving them ideas?”\n\nBut some Spaniards didn’t need any. Far-right fans of Franco visit Franco-themed bars and restaurants around the country. In one such bar in Madrid, wine bottles and tabletops adorned with the dictator’s face sit below walls papered with far-right and white-supremacist slogans, including one reading “Adolf Hitler Was Right.”\n\nFor all the supporters seeking to rehabilitate Franco’s reputation, the dictator has not exactly rested in peace in recent years.\n\nIn 2019, Mr. Sánchez exhumed Franco’s remains from the Valley of the Fallen, a towering mausoleum the dictator had carved over 18 years into a mountain topped by the world’s largest cross. Security guards inside the mountain’s gaping basilica have grown exhausted at pointing out where, behind the altar, the dictator’s tomb once sat.
