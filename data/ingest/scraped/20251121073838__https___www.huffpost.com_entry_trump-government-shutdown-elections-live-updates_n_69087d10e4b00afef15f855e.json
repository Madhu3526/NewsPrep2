  "text": "The U.S. Coast Guard has again classified swastikas and nooses as hate symbols -- and prohibited them.\n\nOn Thursday, The Washington Post reported that under new guidelines, these items were no longer classified as hate symbols and were instead considered merely “potentially divisive.” The policy, which was set to take effect on Dec. 15, was changed to align with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's crusade against “woke” culture, the newspaper reported.\n\nLate Thursday, the Coast Guard published a new policy that described the items as hate symbols and not just as “potentially divisive.” As such, they were expressly prohibited.\n\nAccording to a press release posted on the Coast Guard website: “This is not an updated policy but a new policy to combat any misinformation and double down that the U.S. Coast Guard forbids these symbols.”\n\nAdm. Kevin Lunday, the service’s acting commandant, also sent a memo to the entire Coast Guard that said nooses, swastikas, “and any symbols or flags co-opted or adopted by hate-based groups as representations of supremacy, racial or religious intolerance, anti-semitism, or any other improper bias” were prohibited.",
