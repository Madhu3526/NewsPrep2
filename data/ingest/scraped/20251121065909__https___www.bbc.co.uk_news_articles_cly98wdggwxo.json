  "text": "Victoria told presenter Frances Finn on BBC Radio Lincolnshire that Carr had been a patron of the charity for about nine years and \"has been incredible\".\n\nShe said Carr got involved after meeting a trustee at an auction, where a sculpture of his head was on offer.\n\nVictoria told how the comedian thought no one would want the sculpture, so he bought it himself. Victoria has been told it is in his bathroom.\n\nAfter learning about what the charity did, Carr met parents who had lost children to neuroblastoma and immediately said it was something he wanted to be involved in.\n\nThe charity said since then he had been a \"tireless advocate\".\n\nCarr has previously said it was a \"privilege\" to support the charity and that he was pleased he could use his platform \"to show how amazing this charity is\".\n\nHowever, Victoria said neither she nor her family knew it would be his chosen charity for the TV show until he announced it during the final.\n\n\"We weren't privy to that information so the excitement when he won and announced the charity ... we were absolutely elated,\" Victoria said.\n\n\"It was a range of emotions from glee [to] emotional ... Alan being able to keep the legacy of the charity out there, and the hope of the awareness he was going to be creating for us on the back of this.\"",
