  "text": "The former mayor of a small town in the Philippines was found guilty of human trafficking and sentenced to life in prison on Thursday, more than a year after an investigation into her ties to Chinese organized crime gangs gripped the country.\n\nAlice Guo was convicted of violating Philippine anti-trafficking laws by the Pasig City Regional Trial Court, Deputy State Prosecutor Olivia Torrevillas of the Justice Department said to reporters on Thursday morning. Ms. Guo was elected mayor of Bamban in Tarlac province, about 50 miles north of Manila, in 2022.\n\nHer case gripped the Philippines in 2024 after senators questioned her during a televised public hearing about a suspected gambling operation in Bamban. They accused her of working with Chinese criminal gangs that run online scams and human trafficking.",
