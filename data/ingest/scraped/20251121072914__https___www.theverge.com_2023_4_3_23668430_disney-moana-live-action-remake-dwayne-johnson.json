He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nMoana, which was first released in 2016, is already being adapted for a live-action film. Disney revealed the new project with a video featuring Dwayne Johnson, who plays Maui in the animated movie.\n\n“Like its animated predecessor, the film will celebrate the islands, communities and traditions of Pacific Islanders as seen through the eyes of a young woman eager to pave her own path,” Disney wrote in a press release. “Moana’s journey of self-discovery and reflection on the lives of her ancestors won hearts worldwide, as did her newfound friendship with an exiled demigod named Maui.” Disney didn’t say when the new film might be released.\n\nThe new Moana will join Disney’s growing slate of live-action remakes, including The Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, and next month’s The Little Mermaid. The remakes I’ve watched haven’t lived up to their animated predecessors, but most have proven to be lucrative, so it’s not exactly surprising that Disney is adapting a newer hit like Moana into a live-action film.",
