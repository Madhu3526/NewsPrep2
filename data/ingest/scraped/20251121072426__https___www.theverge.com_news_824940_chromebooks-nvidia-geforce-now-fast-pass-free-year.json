GeForce Now Fast Pass will allow Chromebook owners to stream over 2,000 games directly from an existing PC game library without ads, and new Chromebook purchases will include a year’s membership for free.\n\nFast Pass looks similar to GeForce Now’s existing free plan, which includes the ability to stream more than 2,000 “Ready-to-Play” titles from a user’s existing Steam, Epic, or Xbox libraries. Unlike that plan, the companies say Fast Pass “has no ads,” and “allows you to skip the queue,” compared to typical waits of two minutes or more to start playing on the free plan.\n\nThere are other restrictions, with Fast Pass users limited to 10 hours of cloud gaming each month. Up to five of those can roll over to the next month if you don’t use them up though. Nvidia’s other paid plans, which start at $9.99 per month, support a variety of other features, including higher resolutions, faster frame rates, RTX ray-tracing, and access to a larger game library bolstered by a couple of thousand “Install-to-Play” titles that must be installed onto Nvidia’s servers before you can access them.\n\nGoogle says that anyone who purchases a new Chromebook will now get one year of GeForce Now Fast Pass included. The companies haven’t confirmed how much Fast Pass will cost outside of that offer.",
