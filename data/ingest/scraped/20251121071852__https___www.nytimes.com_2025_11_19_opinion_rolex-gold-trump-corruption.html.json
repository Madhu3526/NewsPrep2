  "text": "This preoccupation with corruption made its way into the Constitution, both as a set of specific prohibitions on titles and emoluments — as well as one of the named offenses (“bribery”) that would justify impeachment — and as a vital part of the structure of the system itself. Why does the Constitution require members of Congress to resign their positions before taking service in the federal government? To guard against “intrigue” among those who serve in the national legislature. “If we do not provide against corruption,” Virginia’s George Mason said in reference to this provision at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia, “our government will soon be at an end.”\n\nWhy, in the case of an Electoral College tie or plurality, does the House and not the Senate choose the president? Because to have such a small and unrepresentative chamber make the decision “lays a certain foundation for corruption and aristocracy,” as another delegate in Philadelphia put it. And why did the framers easily agree to give federal judges life tenure as well as constitutional protection for their compensation? To preclude the corrupt manipulation of the judiciary by those in power. Recall that in the Declaration of Independence, American revolutionaries complained that King George III had “made judges dependent on his will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.”\n\nThe Constitution was meant, in other words, to be a bulwark against corruption of the system and thus of the people. It is obviously not working.\n\nA prohibition like the Article II Emoluments Clause is nothing more than a parchment barrier — if no one acts on it, then it doesn’t really exist. Congress, for reasons of partisan and political self-interest, has been inert. And the Supreme Court, which has claimed for itself the right to remake the Constitution as it sees fit, has all but nullified any attempt to hold corrupt officials accountable by defining bribery out of existence. For Chief Justice John Roberts especially, if it isn’t a direct quid pro quo — one assumes with a sack of money marked with dollar signs — then it doesn’t actually count.\n\nHere it is important to remember that neither the Congress nor the Supreme Court owns the Constitution. Nor, for that matter, does the president. As much as it may often seem otherwise, we are still the authors of our own fates. If we, as citizens, decide that we want to resurrect our nation’s dead commitment to a politics of anti-corruption, then we can. It is within our power to do so, a task to accomplish through political action on the street and at the ballot box.",
