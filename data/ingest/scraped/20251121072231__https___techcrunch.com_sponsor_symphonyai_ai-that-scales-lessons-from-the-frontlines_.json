  "text": "TechCrunch was proud to host SymphonyAI at Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco. Here’s an overview of their AI Stage session.\n\nAI at scale doesn’t look like a lab demo—it looks like factories, payments networks, and grocery supply chains running smarter and faster. On the AI Stage at Disrupt, global companies in financial services, retail, and manufacturing joined Symphony AI CEO Sanjay Dhawan to share lessons from deploying AI globally: what makes scaling possible, how domain context drives outcomes, and why the next wave of enterprise AI is less about hype and more about durable impact. This is AI scaling in the wild—messy, practical, and already reshaping industries.\n\nPresented by:",
