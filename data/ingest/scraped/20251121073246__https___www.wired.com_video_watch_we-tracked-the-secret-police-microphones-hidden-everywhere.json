  "text": "Transcript\n\nThese controversial surveillance devices are designed\n\nto alert authorities to gunshots,\n\nand their exact locations have been kept hidden\n\nfrom police and the public until now.\n\nWIRED obtained leaked documents\n\nthat reveal for the first time the secret locations\n\nof 25,580 ShotSpotter microphones.\n\nIn this video, we'll analyze that data\n\nand test the claim of activists that these sensors lead\n\nto biased over-policing\n\nof communities of color across America.\n\n12 million Americans live in a neighborhood\n\nwith at least one ShotSpotter microphone.\n\nAre you one of them?\n\nLet's put ShotSpotter secret locations on the grid.\n\n[mellow music]\n\n[graphics whirring] [mellow music]\n\nThis is just one of the 25,580 data points\n\nthat represent ShotSpotter microphone locations\n\nas indicated in the leaked documents\n\nprovided to me earlier this year\n\nby a source under the condition of anonymity.\n\nTo confirm that the leaked data was legit,\n\nWIRED vetted the locations\n\nby physically visiting sensors in different cities,\n\nincluding Pasadena, California, Chicago, Illinois.\n\n[Reporter] I think that's it on top of the pole.\n\n[Dhruv] Miami, Florida.\n\n[Reporter] There it is. I see it.\n\nAnd this one attached to a street lamp near Prospect Park\n\nin Brooklyn, New York,\n\nwhere we spotted the protective casing\n\nthat houses the acoustic sensors and processors.\n\nWe even used Google Street View\n\nto virtually visit a random sample\n\nof locations in the document,\n\nand they check out.\n\nThe sensors were exactly where the leaked data\n\nsaid that they would be.\n\nWe don't know if our data set\n\nincludes all sensors that exist,\n\nbut Tom Chittum from SoundThinking,\n\nthe company that makes them,\n\nsaid that as of February 2023,\n\nthe document was likely authentic.\n\nThe data set represents\n\nover a thousand elementary and high schools,\n\ndozens of billboards, scores of hospitals,\n\nand more than a hundred public housing complexes\n\nwhere the sensors are placed.\n\nIn total, the leaked document\n\nindicates ShotSpotter locations\n\nin 84 metropolitan areas across 34 states,\n\nplus US territories such as Puerto Rico\n\nand the Virgin Islands.\n\nNine US cities actually have\n\nmore than 500 sensors installed,\n\nincluding Albuquerque, New Mexico,\n\nChicago, Illinois, Las Vegas, Nevada,\n\nand Washington, D.C.,\n\nwhere sensors can be found on US government buildings,\n\nincluding the headquarters of the FBI,\n\nthe Department of Justice, the US Court of Appeals,\n\nand just outside the city\n\nthroughout the campus of the University of Maryland.\n\nSo why are specific locations chosen for ShotSpotter?\n\nAccording to Tom Chittum,\n\nwhen police departments purchase SoundThinking services,\n\nthey provide the company with data\n\nabout gun violence in the area.\n\nOnce a plan is agreed upon by the department,\n\nSoundThinking will seek permission\n\nfrom private property owners, utility companies,\n\nand business owners\n\nto install sensors on their premises.\n\nWhile Chittum says that most property owners\n\nagree to do so without needing incentivization,\n\nthe company will occasionally offer gift cards\n\nto secure access to their private property.\n\nAccording to the company,\n\nif a loud, impulsive sound is heard in the coverage area,\n\nsensors often on top of buildings\n\nand streetlights pick it up.\n\nThe location of the incident is determined\n\nby measuring the time the sound takes\n\nto travel to each sensor.\n\nAt minimum, three sensors need to detect a sound\n\nfor it to be flagged.\n\nThe sound is then first analyzed by AI\n\nto determine if it's likely a gunshot\n\nbefore being sent to a ShotSpotter incident review center\n\nwhere analysts determine whether it's gunfire\n\nor something else,\n\nlike a firework or a car backfiring.\n\nIf it's a gunshot,\n\nShotSpotter then alerts law enforcement.\n\nSoundThinking claims they keep the exact locations\n\nof their sensors secret, even from police,\n\nto protect people who allow the sensors on their property\n\nas well as to prevent the mics themselves\n\nfrom being tampered with or vandalized.\n\nBut this secrecy has been a point of contention\n\nfor those who criticize the company.\n\n[Protestors] DPD we want you out.\n\n[Dhruv] The ACLU argues that, quote,\n\nThere are deep problems\n\nwith the gunshot detection company\n\nand its technology,\n\nincluding its methodology, effectiveness,\n\nand impact on communities of color.\n\nSo are activists right?\n\nWhere are these microphones being placed?\n\nWIRED did some digging and found the answer.\n\nAfter receiving the leaked documents\n\nof the sensor locations,\n\nwe used the most recent census data\n\nand collected the demographic information\n\nfrom every census block group\n\nwith at least one SoundThinking sensor.\n\nEach census block group\n\nhas between 600 and 3,000 people in it.\n\nWe then analyzed sensor distribution in US cities\n\nand found that, in aggregate, 70% of people\n\nwho live in a neighborhood\n\nwith at least one SoundThinking sensor\n\nidentified as either Black or Latino,\n\nnearly 3/4 of these neighborhoods are majority non-white,\n\nand the average household earns\n\na little more than 50,000 a year.\n\nBut let's zoom in and look at individual jurisdictions.\n\nThe pattern appears to be the same.\n\nWinston-Salem, North Carolina, for example,\n\nis approximately 43% white,\n\nbut only 13% of residents who live in areas\n\nthat have at least one ShotSpotter sensor\n\nidentified as white.\n\nIn Fort Myers, Florida,\n\nroughly 19% of the population is Black.\n\nIn block groups with at least one sensor, however,\n\napproximately 41% of the population is Black.\n\nSo WIRED's findings do align\n\nwith the theory put forth by activists and critics\n\nthat ShotSpotter surveillance does disproportionately occur\n\nin poor communities of color.\n\nWhy invest in ShotSpotter\n\nwhen it's shown it doesn't curb gun violence,\n\nit doesn't do what it says it's supposed to do?\n\nSo what happens when police answer a call\n\nbased on a ShotSpotter report in one of these neighborhoods?\n\nLet's go to Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nIt's New Year's Eve 2022, 8:21 p.m.\n\nSeveral sensors pick up two loud sounds\n\nthat could be gunshots.\n\nThis is body cam footage\n\nthat WIRED obtained of the incident.\n\nYou can see police detaining a man\n\nwho happened to be standing near the corner\n\nwhere the ShotSpotter mics detected supposed gunfire.\n\nNine officers were sent to the location to respond.\n\nHowever, once there, they found no gun,\n\nno bullet casings, no bullet holes,\n\nnor any evidence that a crime had been committed there.\n\n[Officer] So we kind of did about 10 feet out\n\nand there's nothing, unless he had a revolver.\n\nYet cops still arrested man after they ran his name\n\nand found he'd failed to appear in court\n\nfor traffic violations.\n\nThis incident tracks with a 2021\n\nNorthwestern University School of Law study\n\nwhich found that over a two-year period,\n\n89% of alerts in the city of Chicago did not result\n\nin police finding evidence of a gun-related crime.\n\nThis is likely at least in part due\n\nto how often suspected gunfire alerts\n\nend up being something else entirely.\n\nFor example, according to this article,\n\nofficers in Pasadena responding\n\nto scenes of ShotSpotter alerts\n\nhave pointed to backfiring cars, fireworks,\n\nor even noisy construction as the actual sources\n\nof the sounds the sensors detected,\n\nand that's when the sensors were actually working.\n\n[mellow music]\n\nIn December 2022, SoundThinking sensors failed\n\nto issue an alert for a shooting at a gyros shop in Chicago\n\nthat wounded two men.\n\nReportedly, 55 rounds were fired,\n\nyet SoundThinking's equipment sent out no alerts.\n\nThe missed detections were apparently due\n\nto three out-of-service sensors.\n\nIn fact, according to the leaked document,\n\nas many as 357 sensors in the Chicago metropolitan area\n\nwere broken, unreliable, or out of service at the time.\n\nThat's 9% of the total sensors in the city.\n\n2,680 of SoundThinking sensors nationwide, one in 10,\n\nwere categorized as either broken, unreliable,\n\nor out of service at the time the file was created,\n\nallegedly late last year.\n\nThis past September, Mayor Brandon Johnson,\n\na vocal critic of ShotSpotter,\n\nsaid the city will not renew\n\nits contract with SoundThinking.\n\nOn a side note, one interesting use case for ShotSpotter\n\ncan be found way across the world in South Africa.\n\nThe Kruger National Park,\n\none of the most renowned wildlife conservation areas\n\nin the world,\n\nhas sensors throughout its grounds,\n\npresumably to curb the poaching of endangered species.\n\nWanna see if there's a ShotSpotter near you?\n\nClick on the WIRED article in this video's description\n\nand search the data yourself.\n\nI'm Dhruv Mehrotra.\n\nThanks for watching On the Grid.\n\n[mellow music]",
