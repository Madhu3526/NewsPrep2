  "title": "Catholic Group Sues Trump Administration for Access to Immigration Facility",
  "text": "A religious nonprofit and several Roman Catholic clergy filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Wednesday claiming that immigration authorities had unlawfully blocked its members from ministering to people at a detention center near Chicago.\n\nThe suit, led by the Coalition for Spiritual and Public Leadership, a Catholic advocacy group based in Illinois, is the latest to accuse the administration of creating unlawful, unsanitary and unsafe conditions at such centers.\n\nRoman Catholic bishops in the United States criticized the administration’s deportation campaign in a statement passed this month at their annual conference in Baltimore. The statement presented a united front with Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the United States, who grew up in suburban Chicago and has been speaking in support of immigrants.\n\nThe new lawsuit focuses on an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in Broadview, Ill., that has become a symbol of the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigration. It was filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The Department of Homeland Security, which includes ICE, did not respond to a request for comment.",
