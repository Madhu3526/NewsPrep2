  "text": "Prosecution spent more than £350k on barrister fees in Soldier F case\n\nSoldier F was found not guilty of murder and attempted murder in Londonderry on Bloody Sunday\n\nThe case took six years to reach trial and involved multiple preliminary hearings and a judicial review.\n\nBBC News NI asked it to provide a breakdown of its total costs for the case, after it emerged the government spent £4.3m on the veteran's defence .\n\nFigures were released by the PPS under a Freedom of Information (FoI) request.\n\nThe Public Prosecution Service (PPS) spent more than £350,000 on barrister fees in the case of Soldier F, the former British Army paratrooper acquitted of Bloody Sunday murder charges .\n\nThe PPS said counsel costs to date are £362,552, including the judicial review and the five week trial at Belfast Crown Court.\n\nIt added some fees \"are yet to be processed\" but said the overall cost to the PPS could not be quantified.\n\n\"In the absence of detailed records of time spent on individual cases, it is not possible to produce precise costs, or even average costs for a particular type of case,\" the PPS said.\n\n\"This is because the amount of time required to take individual decisions as to prosecution (and for related administrative tasks) will vary depending upon a range of factors, including the complexity of the case.\"\n\nIt said its counsel fees are, however, \"identifiable\" costs.\n\nSoldier F, whose anonymity is protected by a court order, had been charged with murder and attempted murder in Londonderry on Bloody Sunday.\n\nThat day 13 people were shot dead and at least 15 others injured on 30 January 1972 at a civil rights demonstration in the Bogside area of the city.\n\nSoldier F was found not guilty at a trial in October.",
