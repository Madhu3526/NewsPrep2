  "text": "TechCrunch was proud to host Epic Aircraft at Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco. Here’s an overview of their Builders Stage session.\n\nThe aviation industry had long been slowed by legacy systems and lengthy certification processes—but Epic Aircraft proved change was possible. The Oregon-based disruptor earned FAA type certification for its E1000 AX in July 2025 and pioneered the use of AI across design, testing, certification workflows, and customer support.\n\nBy embracing smart automation, Epic scaled faster and more efficiently than traditional manufacturers. The session offered an inside look at how AI reshaped the future of flight, what aerospace learned from startup culture, and how innovation accelerated speed, safety, and performance when Silicon Valley thinking met aviation’s next frontier.\n\nPresented by:",
