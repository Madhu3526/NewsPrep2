  "text": "That’s not to say that the A.I. bubble won’t burst. Investors and governments have placed their wagers on a group of racehorses, only a handful of which will win. Yet while the rest may well be destined for the glue factory, resulting in significant losses, the race itself will yield innovations that could result in vastly superior outcomes for many than would otherwise be the case.\n\nThe bubble will pop not because investors are overestimating A.I. but because of these three forces: Think, first, of all the tech companies working on groundbreaking models, an arms race between giants. Not all will flourish, especially as the required funds — for elite engineers in high demand, sprawling data centers and energy consumption — continue to soar. While Google and Microsoft can lean on their many revenue generators, other players will have to rely even more heavily on debt funding or circular financing that will ultimately prove unsustainable.\n\nSecond, a gold rush attracts prospectors with fool’s gold. Companies plaster an A.I. label onto more mundane services, attracting less informed investors. This A.I.-washing is reminiscent of the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s, when adding “.com” to a start-up’s name was a shortcut to a dizzying, and ultimately illusory, valuation.\n\nThird, external developments may well derail some firms. These could include sudden regulatory changes, bad actors, geopolitical fractures of the A.I. supply chain and a lack of widespread A.I. adoption. Any of these would hinder the ability of some of the companies building the models to generate enough revenue.\n\nSurging A.I. stocks are pulling up the valuations of many other companies, some to highly elevated levels. That’s because investors attracted by a handful of big tech names have fueled a much larger buying surge into investment vehicles, including index funds, and because buyers searching for new places to put their money often venture to areas they insufficiently understand.",
