  "text": "Florida’s natural springs are more than scenic wonders - they are portals to a prehistoric world hidden beneath turquoise and deep-blue waters.\n\nAmong the most striking sites are Devil’s Den and Silver Springs, where divers descend into freshwater sinkholes to uncover fossilised remains of Ice Age giants. These silent relics evoke a time when colossal creatures roamed the Earth – and offer a stark reminder of our planet’s fragility and uncertain future.",
