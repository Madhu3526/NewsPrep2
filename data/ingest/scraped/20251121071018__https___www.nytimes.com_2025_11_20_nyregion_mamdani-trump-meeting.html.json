  "text": "He views Mr. Mamdani as a liability for Democrats in the midterm elections next year, and would not seem to be motivated to do anything that might help him — he even gave Mr. Mamdani’s chief primary rival, former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, his endorsement on the eve of Election Day. At the same time, it is unlikely that the president wishes to be seen as contributing to the city’s decline.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said on Thursday “it speaks volumes” that a “communist” was going to the White House. (Mr. Mamdani is a democratic socialist.)\n\n“It speaks to the fact that President Trump is willing to meet with anyone and talk to anyone and to try to do what’s right on behalf of the American people whether they live in blue states or red states or blue cities — in a city that’s becoming much more left than I think this president ever anticipated in his many years of living in New York,” she said.\n\nWhite House officials did not say whether journalists will be allowed into the Oval Office for any part of the meeting, and neither side would say what was to be discussed. There is no shortage of potential topics, including Mr. Trump’s previous threats to send the National Guard into the city and to withhold billions of dollars in federal funding.\n\nThe two politicians have things in common. Both have ties to Queens, loyal followings and a powerful social media presence. And in private, Mr. Trump has described Mr. Mamdani as a talented politician.",
