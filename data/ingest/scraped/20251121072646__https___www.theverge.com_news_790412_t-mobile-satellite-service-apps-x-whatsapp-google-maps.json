Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nT-Mobile has expanded its satellite-to-cell service to several popular apps in the US, allowing users to stay connected without cellular coverage. The Starlink-powered “T-Satellite” service now supports WhatsApp, Google Maps, X, AccuWeather, and T-Mobile’s customer service app T-Life, alongside the AllTrails, CalTopo, and onX outdoor exploration apps.\n\nT-Satellite is free on most T-Mobile subscriber plans, or can be purchased for $10 a month. Users with eligible devices will be automatically connected to the satellite network when cellular or Wi-Fi is unavailable. Supported apps will be limited to providing critical content instead of “full data-heavy experiences” over satellite, according to T-Mobile’s announcement.\n\nWhatsApp connectivity will allow users to send messages, voice notes, and images, and supports voice and video calls, even in group chats. For X, the limited service lets you post text, photos, GIFs, or videos, and explore feeds while controlling when to load high-resolution media to conserve data.\n\nThe service already provides connectivity to native apps on select iPhone, Pixel, and Samsung phone models, such as Google Messages and Find Hub, Apple Music, Fitness, Maps, and Weather, and Samsung’s Weather app. The expansion to third-party apps is a notable milestone for T-Satellite, which only supported text messaging and location-sharing when it launched in July.",
