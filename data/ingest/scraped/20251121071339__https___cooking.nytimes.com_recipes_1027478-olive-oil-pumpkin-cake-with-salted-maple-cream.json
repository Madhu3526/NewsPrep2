  "text": "If pumpkin pie feels tired, this cake is the upgrade: It’s plush and deeply spiced without veering into heaviness, the kind of dessert that feels just as welcome at a holiday table as it does on a random Tuesday night. The salted maple whipped cream is what makes it sing, adding a cool, fluffy richness to balance the spice. (Sneak some bites but please, do your best to get as much of it onto the cake as possible.) Like most oil-based cakes, this pumpkin cake actually improves with time, so don’t hesitate to bake it a day ahead; the flavors settle in and the crumb gets even more tender.",
