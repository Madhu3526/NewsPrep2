In a press release on Wednesday, Adobe says the deal will allow it and Semrush to give marketers insight into how their brands appear across the web.\n\nThe acquisition builds on Adobe’s existing suite of marketing tools that help businesses manage digital campaigns and analyze web traffic. Adobe has begun incorporating AI into its marketing platform as well, as it now allows brands to generate ads using the technology. It also announced that it’s building an AI agent designed to brainstorm social media campaigns last month.\n\nIn addition to taking advantage of Semrush’s search engine optimization (SEO) capabilities, Adobe plans on incorporating the company’s tools that help brands appear inside AI-generated search results or responses.\n\nIn 2023, Adobe dropped its $20 billion deal to acquire the collaborative design platform Figma after facing pressure from regulators in the UK and the European Union. Adobe’s deal to acquire Semrush is expected to close in the first half of 2026. It’s still subject to the approval of regulators, as well as Semrush stockholders.",
