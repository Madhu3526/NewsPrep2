  "title": "Sheet-Pan Feta With Corn and Shishito Peppers Recipe",
  "text": "It takes fewer than 10 minutes for the broiler to deliver a complete meal of molten, salty feta, sweet corn and smoky shishito peppers. While grilling cheese with vegetables is common in Mexican and Mediterranean traditions, this indoor, sheet pan rendition catches all the juices and oozing cheese as the feta slouches and chars and the vegetables plump and caramelize. Red onion quick-pickled in lime juice and a flurry of herbs cut through the richness. Serve it straight from the pan with warm pita, tortillas, quinoa, orzo, avocado, tzatziki or refried beans. For a kick, add thinly sliced jalapeños or serrano to the red onions, or top your plates with pico de gallo or hot sauce.",
