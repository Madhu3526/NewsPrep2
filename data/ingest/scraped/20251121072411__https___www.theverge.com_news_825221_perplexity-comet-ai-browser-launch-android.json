Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nPerplexity is launching its AI-powered browser on Android. The new Comet app is available to download now, and it comes with many of the same features as the desktop version of the browser, including the ability to summon Perplexity’s built-in AI assistant while you surf the web.\n\nIt’s one of the first major AI-centric browsers to arrive on mobile. ChatGPT Atlas is still only available on macOS; Google put Gemini inside Chrome’s desktop and mobile apps, though it works more like an extension rather than a full-fledged AI browsing experience. Comet launched on desktop for Perplexity Max subscribers in July before rolling it out more widely last month.\n\nYou can use voice mode on Comet’s Android app as well. Image: Perplexity\n\nJust like Comet on desktop, you can use voice mode on the browser’s Android app to chat about the information in your tabs, as well as ask Perplexity to generate summaries of what you’re seeing. You can’t sync your browsing history or bookmarks across Comet’s mobile and desktop apps just yet, but Perplexity spokesperson Beejoli Shah tells The Verge that it’s on the startup’s “roadmap to roll out in the coming weeks.”\n\nPerplexity is working on adding full support for other Comet features, too, including a fully agentic voice mode and a built-in password manager. Shah notes that you can still use Android’s password manager with the browser, though.",
