  "title": "Survivors Describe Deadly Snowstorm in Chilean Patagonia",
  "text": "When the hikers left the campsite early Monday, it was drizzling, windy and just above freezing in Torres del Paine, a national park with towering granite peaks and glaciers in Chilean Patagonia. They had the most difficult stretch of their journey ahead.\n\nBut they had no idea they would be hit by a blizzard with hurricane-force winds of 120 miles an hour, unable to see more than 10 feet ahead. Within hours, more than two dozen were injured and five were missing.\n\nThe next day, the authorities confirmed that all five of the missing — tourists from Mexico, Britain and Germany — had died.\n\nAt a news conference on Thursday, Cristián Crisosto, the regional prosecutor for Magallanes, which includes the national park, said that he had opened an investigation and that the police were taking statements from park staff, from Vertice, the company that operates the campground, known as Los Perros, and from 69 people who were there on the day of the snowstorm.",
