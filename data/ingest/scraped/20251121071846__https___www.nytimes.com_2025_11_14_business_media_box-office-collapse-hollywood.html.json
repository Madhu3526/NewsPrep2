  "title": "25 Movies, Many Stars, 0 Hits: Hollywood Falls to New Lows",
  "text": "Some were heavily marketed. Many were championed by critics. Most had star power.\n\nBut not one of the 25 dramas and comedies that movie companies released in North American theaters over the past three months has become a hit, certainly not in the way that Hollywood has historically kept score. Some have played to near-empty auditoriums, including “After the Hunt,” starring Julia Roberts; “Christy,” with Sydney Sweeney; and “Die My Love,” featuring Jennifer Lawrence and Robert Pattinson.\n\n“To succeed in theaters today, dramas and comedies must have event status — something truly elevated and special,” said Kevin Goetz, an author of the new book “How to Score in Hollywood,” which looks at film bankability.\n\n“It’s not a phase,” he added. “It’s an evolution you can’t reverse.”\n\nThe dearth has added to what has already been a troubled year for Hollywood. The summer season — filled with fantasies and science-fiction sequels — was the least attended since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the Covid-19 pandemic years.\n\nHere is what you need to know.\n\nWhat constitutes a hit?\n\nWhile success at the box office is always correlated to how much it costs to make a film, Hollywood has historically used $50 million in ticket sales (over an entire run) as a benchmark for a “widely seen” drama or comedy.",
