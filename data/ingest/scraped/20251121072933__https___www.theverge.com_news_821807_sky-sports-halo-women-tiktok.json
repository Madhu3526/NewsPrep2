He has over 18 years of experience, including 10 years as managing editor at Engadget.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nThat Sky Sports felt the need to launch a TikTok channel specifically marketed towards women and billed as its “lil sis” was questionable enough. But once people got a taste of the content on Halo, it was clear the company had absolutely no idea what it was doing.\n\nHalo didn’t focus on women’s sports, nor did it seem to be doing a good job of elevating female voices in a male-dominated business. Instead, it slapped pink sparkly letters on videos, talked about “hot girl walks,” matcha, and posted shipping memes. Unsurprisingly, the backlash was swift and strong.\n\nHead of audience development and social media at Sky Sports, Andy Gill, posted on LinkedIn that he, “couldn’t be prouder and more excited about this launch. Proud, because this has been driven by the women in our team…” However, it seems hard to believe, considering the outcry from female sports fans, that Halo’s development was actually driven by the women at the company.",
