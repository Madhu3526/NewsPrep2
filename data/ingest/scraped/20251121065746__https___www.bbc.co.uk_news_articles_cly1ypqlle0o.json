  "text": "In a statement on X, Zelensky wrote: \"The American side presented points of a plan to end the war—their vision. I outlined our key principles. We agreed that our teams will work on the points to ensure it's all genuine.\"\n\nThe statement came after a meeting in Kyiv on Thursday between Zelensky and senior US military figures, including US Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, army chief of staff Gen Randy George and top US army commander in Europe Gen Chris Donahue.\n\nDespite Kyiv's tepid reaction to the draft, Zelensky said he \"appreciated the efforts of President Trump and his team to return security to Europe\" – perhaps a way to keep the US president onside despite his administration's apparent soft approach to Russia.\n\nIn his nightly address on Thursday, Zelensky said Ukraine needs a \"worthy peace,\" and that the \"dignity of the Ukrainian people\" must be respected.\n\nWhen asked if Europe was involved in the process of drafting the plan, EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said: \"Not that I know of.\"\n\n\"For any plan to work, it needs Ukrainians and Europeans on board,\" she added.\n\nMoscow downplayed the significance of the plan, which is rumoured to include 28 points.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that while there had been \"contacts\" with the US there was \"no process that could be called 'consultations'\".\n\nPeskov warned that any peace deal would have to address the \"root causes of the conflict\" - a phrase Moscow has used as shorthand for a series of maximalist demands which, to Ukraine, are tantamount to surrender.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said: \"The future of Ukraine must be determined by Ukraine and we must never lose sight of that principle underpinning the just and lasting peace that we all want to see.\"\n\nSince starting his second term earlier this year, Trump has launched into various initiatives aimed at ending the war in Ukraine, including a bilateral summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska, several visits by his envoy Witkoff to Moscow, and rounds of talks with Zelensky and other Western leaders.\n\nBut as the fourth anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine nears, the two sides remain deeply at odds over how to end the conflict.\n\nWhile Ukraine has become adept at targeting Russian military infrastructure and energy facilities with long-range drones, Moscow's attacks on Ukrainian targets continue unabated.\n\nLate on Thursday, a Russian attack on the Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least five people, according to the regional governor. Hours later, Russia's defence ministry said it had intercepted and destroyed 33 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions.\n\nEarlier this week, at least 26 people were killed in a Russian missile and drone attack on blocks of flats in Ukraine's western city of Ternopil. Another 17 people were still missing at the site on Thursday, Zelensky said as he offered his condolences.",
