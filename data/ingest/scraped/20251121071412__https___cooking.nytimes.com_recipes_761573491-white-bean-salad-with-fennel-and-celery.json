  "title": "White Bean Salad With Fennel and Celery Recipe",
  "text": "Like so many bean salads, this one is delicious the day it's made, but gets even better as it sits. You can marinate the beans in the dressing ahead of time, and they’ll soak it up and become more flavorful in the fridge. When you're ready to serve, simply fold in the onion, fennel, celery and dill. This salad is a satisfying vegan dish on its own, but it also pairs beautifully with seared tuna. To make it more substantial, consider adding a jar of olive oil-marinated tuna or some roasted salmon.",
