  "text": "Adverts by four of Britain's biggest hotel and travel firms have been banned for stating misleading minimum prices for rooms.\n\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) upheld complaints against the Hilton hotel group, Travelodge, Booking.com and Accor over their use of eye-catching so-called \"from\" prices.\n\nThe watchdog found only a small number of rooms actually available to book at the promoted price and concluded the adverts overstated the deals.\n\nIt said this was unfair on those looking for good deals or seeking to make informed choices about where to book.",
