  "title": "Melania Trump’s Green Gown Signals Saudi Arabia Diplomatic Ties",
  "text": "There were many ways in which President Trump used the pageantry of office to demonstrate the new friendship between the United States and Saudi Arabia during Tuesday’s visit by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to the White House.\n\nMr. Trump rolled out the red carpet. He organized a military flyover. He threw a black-tie quasi-state dinner — the first such official dinner of his second term — complete with soccer stars and tech and Wall Street billionaires. And he captured it all for posterity with various photo ops.\n\nBut perhaps the most unexpected reflection of the new special relationship between the two countries came not from the president but from the first lady.\n\nMelania Trump has, after all, been a somewhat scant presence in the administration. She is often not in the White House. When she appears at major public events, she has a tendency to wear a hat that hides half her face, as she did at the inauguration and during a recent state visit to Britain. She often seems more interested in the decorative side of her job than in being a diplomatic tool, and she defines decorative as she likes rather than as history has dictated.",
