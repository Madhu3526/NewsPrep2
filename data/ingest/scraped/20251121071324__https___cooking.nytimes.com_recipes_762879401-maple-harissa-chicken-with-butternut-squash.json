  "title": "Maple Harissa Chicken With Butternut Squash Recipe",
  "text": "This bold, comforting sheet-pan dinner is the kind of weeknight dinner that delivers maximum flavor with minimal effort. Chicken thighs are coated in a vibrant marinade made with harissa, maple syrup, garlic and warming spices, then roasted until golden and caramelized alongside cubes of butternut squash and pops of edamame. The quality of the harissa really matters in this recipe, so look for one with a rich, complex flavor rather than overwhelming heat. The balance of sweet, spicy and savory notes makes this recipe deeply satisfying and endlessly adaptable. You can easily swap the butternut squash for sweet potatoes or carrots, depending on what you have on hand. The same marinade also works beautifully with slabs of firm tofu or salmon fillets, though you’ll need to reduce the cooking time accordingly. Serve this dish straight from the pan with couscous, rice or warm flatbread to make it a complete meal.",
