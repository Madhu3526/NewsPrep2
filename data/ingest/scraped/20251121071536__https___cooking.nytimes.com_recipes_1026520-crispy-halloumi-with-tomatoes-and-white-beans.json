  "text": "After so many years and enjoyment of the NYT recipes, this is the first time as the first reviewer and posted comment. Made this as written, except I already had fresh cilantro on hand, so I added dried cilantro instead of oregano. I love halloumi, and broiling it was so easy. As noted, this was quick to put together and delivered way above expectations. Loved this, and will be making it again.\n\nIs this helpful? 604",
