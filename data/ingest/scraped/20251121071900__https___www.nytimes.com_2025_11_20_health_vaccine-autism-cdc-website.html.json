  "text": "The updated text also claimed that the health authorities have “ignored” studies supporting a link and said that the Department of Health and Human Services was conducting a “comprehensive assessment” of the causes of autism.\n\nStudies over the past three decades consistently have not found any connection between vaccines and autism, including one from 2019 in Denmark that examined the country’s entire child population over a decade.\n\nThe phrase “Vaccines do not cause autism” still appeared on the new C.D.C. page. A footnote explained that the language had not been removed because of an agreement with Senator Bill Cassidy, Republican of Louisiana, that it remain on the C.D.C. website. Senator Cassidy is a medical doctor and is the chairman of the Senate’s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. At least one other C.D.C. page continued to say there was no link, as did a page on the website for the Food and Drug Administration, which Mr. Kennedy also oversees.\n\nSenator Cassidy’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAndrew Nixon, the communications director for the Health and Human Services agency, defended the change and reiterated that it had begun “a comprehensive assessment of the causes of autism.”\n\nThe new webpage pleased anti-vaccine activists. “Finally, the CDC is beginning to acknowledge the truth about this condition that affects millions,” said Children’s Health Defense, an anti-vaccine organization founded by Mr. Kennedy, on social media on Wednesday.",
