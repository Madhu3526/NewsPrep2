  "text": "Transcript\n\nHi, we're the cast of Final Destination Bloodlines.\n\nAnd we are here to answer the top 50 most Googled questions\n\nabout the franchise.\n\n[robotic techno music]\n\nOkay.\n\nI love this question.\n\nIs the rollercoaster from Final Destination real?\n\nYes, and I've been on it 'cause it was shot in Vancouver.\n\nOh yeah. And you've been on it too.\n\nAnd I used to pray before going on it.\n\nDo we get bonus points?\n\nBecause that rollercoaster is real,\n\nbut it in fact no longer exists.\n\nYeah, it's gone now. Oh.\n\nIt is gone as of two years ago.\n\nHer name was The Corkscrew. The Corkscrew.\n\nAdd a little bummer.\n\nWhen was Final Destination 2 released?\n\n2004.\n\nNo, 2002.\n\nI think two years after the original.\n\nSo, it was the 25 year anniversary.\n\nOh. Yeah.\n\nIn March. Yeah.\n\nI say 2002.\n\nSo 2002 sounds right. Let's lock in 2002.\n\nI like 2002. What is 2002?\n\nWhat does 180 mean in Final Destination?\n\nIt's the flight number.\n\nOh yeah.\n\nWow.\n\nFun fact was what the movie,\n\nthe first movie was originally gonna be called.\n\nYeah, it was supposed to be called Flight 180.\n\nI didn't know that. Oh. Yeah.\n\nFun fact, the car that I drive up to the tower,\n\nat the restaurant in,\n\nhas a license plate and I think it's Flight 180\n\nis the license plate.\n\nThere's a bunch of little [indistinct] like that.\n\n[cast members cross talking indistinctly]\n\nI think it's like FLT 180, yeah.\n\nI love Easter eggs. We have a lot Easter eggs.\n\nDid you just pick up on that on that\n\nwhen you watched the movie?\n\nNo. I didn't see any of that.\n\nAdam and Zach told me for sure.\n\nWhat happens at the movie theater?\n\nUsually, you watch movies. Oh, oh, oh...\n\nI know this one. It depends.\n\nOh, what is it? Is it in the movie?\n\nOh, it explodes.\n\nIt blows up. No, it almost blows up.\n\nHe stops it, 'cause the sprinklers.\n\nOh, is that the premonition that?\n\nYeah 'cause... Oh my God.\n\nLooks like it explodes.\n\nHe's like urgh. I totally missed that.\n\nAnd then he grabs the stick that's on fire,\n\nand he puts it up to the sprinkler.\n\nThis is very good. Then it stops it. Yes.\n\n[cast members cross talking indistinctly]\n\nGood job, Teo. Let's go. Well done.\n\nIn Final Destination 3,\n\nwhich two characters died first?\n\nRichard? Richard?\n\nThis is a lot of pressure on me right now.\n\n'Cause the first thing that happened-\n\n[cast members cross talking indistinctly]\n\nIt was the rollercoaster. It was the rollercoaster.\n\nI don't know the names of the characters.\n\nHow dare you.\n\nBut they were very important. [buzzer ringing]\n\nThe important characters that we don't know.\n\nThe two people that died first\n\nwere the two people that died first.\n\nOkay. Was Erik Campbell adopted?\n\nAre we allowed to?\n\nWho's Erik Campbell?\n\nWait, Erik...\n\nIt was me. [cast members laughing]\n\nYour cousin.\n\nWho's Erik Campbell. Oh, that.\n\nI don't know him.\n\nErik Campbell was not adopted.\n\nOkay. Speed round. How did Ashley and Ashlyn die?\n\nOh my gosh.\n\nA train? In the car wash?\n\nNo, they almost died in the car wash.\n\nOh, did they die in the tanning beds?\n\nThe tanning beds. [cast members cheering]\n\nCome on, cast.\n\nTwo Vancouver actors, Crystal Lowe and Chelan Simmons.\n\nYeah.\n\nAre all the Final Destination deaths\n\nconnected to each other?\n\nThat's an interesting question.\n\nYou know. Potentially.\n\nThere's a way you could think about it\n\nwhere the answer is yes.\n\nIt's debatable.\n\nBecause the consequences of the fifth movie\n\nare what caused the first movie.\n\nSo technically, you could, yeah.\n\nOh yeah. That's a great answer.\n\n[cast members cross talking]\n\nI mean, I'm spoiling like 20-year-old movies,\n\nso I'm not... [buzzer ringing]\n\nIf you haven't seen it, go see it.\n\nDo we get to keep these?\n\nYeah. Yeah?\n\nYou gotta know... Hell yeah.\n\nHow many people died at McKinley Speedway?\n\n1 million.\n\nI know this one. Do you?\n\nI don't want to answer it right now.\n\nYou done with that? Yeah.\n\nPut that in the collection. Oh, you know?\n\nIs it just because the premonition is at the speedway.\n\n1 million.\n\nBut then, they go out. They stop it.\n\nI forget how many people die when we get out\n\nLet's say 12?\n\nBecause then there's the guy who's in the back.\n\nAnd he's kind of yelling, it's him and his wife.\n\nAnd then, the tire comes from over the top and smokes 'em.\n\nThat's right.\n\nAnd this renders him into a pink mist.\n\nBut did people actually die after they kind of-\n\nOver or under eight? Yeah, who's to say?\n\nI'm gonna say over eight. Over or under eight?\n\nDefinitely over eight. Don't even know the scene.\n\n12? I think over eight.\n\nI was going 12. 12?\n\nWhy did I say it was like 1 million.\n\nI like 12. 257.\n\n[buzzer ringing]\n\nHow many people do you think go NASCAR?\n\nI dunno. way too many.\n\nWho got impaled by a flagpole?\n\nOh.\n\nI know exactly who it is,\n\nbut I don't know what their name is.\n\nWell, just... wasn't it in...\n\nI think I got impaled by a flagpole.\n\nI was like, hello.\n\nIt was Brec.\n\nBrec, nice to meet you.\n\nWho got strangled by a clothes line\n\nafter slipping in a bathroom?\n\nOh, that's the first one.
