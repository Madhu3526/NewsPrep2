  "text": "A New Jersey fraudster who was pardoned by President Trump in 2021 was sentenced to 37 years in prison this month for running a $44 million Ponzi scheme, one of a growing number of people granted clemency by Mr. Trump only to be charged with new crimes.\n\nThe man, Eliyahu Weinstein, was pardoned by Mr. Trump in 2021 and was re-indicted by the U.S. attorney’s office in New Jersey three years later. He was accused of swindling investors who thought their money was being used to buy surgical masks, baby formula and first-aid kits bound for Ukraine, and a jury convicted him in April of several crimes, including conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud.\n\n“Mr. Weinstein received a gift only a few have received in the United States, a presidential commutation,” Judge Michael Shipp of Federal District Court in New Jersey said during the sentencing hearing. “Just months after he was released from prison and while on supervised release, he squandered this coveted gift by immediately defrauding investors of their hard-earned money.”\n\nMr. Weinstein’s victims included a single mother of three who was compelled to sell her home after failing to receive the returns she had expected. Calling Mr. Weinstein a “predator,” Judge Shipp concluded that, as the ringleader of the scheme, he deserved “the harshest punishment.”",
