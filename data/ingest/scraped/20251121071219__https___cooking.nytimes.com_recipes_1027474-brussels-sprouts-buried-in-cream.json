  "text": "Step 4\n\nReduce heat to medium heat and pour in the cream. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the cream has reduced by half and is thick enough to coat the sprouts, 8 to 10 minutes. Stir in the lemon zest, season with salt and pepper and give it a taste. You want to make sure the brussels are deeply seasoned before going into the oven. Remove from heat and transfer the brussels sprouts mixture to a shallow 2-quart baking dish. (This mixture can be assembled, covered and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead. Bring to room temperature before topping with the bread crumb mixture and baking.)",
