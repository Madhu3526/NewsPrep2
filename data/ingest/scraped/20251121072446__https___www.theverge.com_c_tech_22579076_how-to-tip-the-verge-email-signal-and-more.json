  "text": "Some of our most important stories start with tips. We’re always looking for information about the companies and products that shape the way we live, insight into the government agencies responsible for regulating the environment and tech we interact with daily, and other stories about the impact technology has on human beings. Evidence is key: firsthand experience or revealing documents will be more useful than a hunch. Have you encountered something that the public should know about? If so, we want to hear from you.\n\nNote: this is only for editorial tips. For advertising, technical support, and other inquiries, go here .\n\nHow to tip The Verge\n\nEmail\n\nEmail is the easiest way to reach us. Send tips to the general Verge email here: tips@theverge.com\n\nIf you are at risk of reprisals, do not use your work email, Wi-Fi, or device.\n\nSignal\n\nYou can also send tips using the app Signal, which encrypts text messages and calls. Signal stores your number and the last time you accessed the app, but not who you communicate with. Be sure not to use your work phone. You can download Signal here.\n\nEmail addresses and Signal accounts for specific Verge staffers can be found on their author pages linked on this staff list.\n\nDepending on what version of Signal you’re using, you may need to add numbers as a contact before beginning a conversation. The contact can be deleted once the conversation has begun. The Freedom of the Press Foundation offers additional guidelines for locking down security on Signal.",
