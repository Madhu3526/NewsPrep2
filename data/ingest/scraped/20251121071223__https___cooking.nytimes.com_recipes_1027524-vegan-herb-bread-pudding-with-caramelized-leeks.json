  "title": "Vegan Herb Bread Pudding With Caramelized Leeks Recipe",
  "text": "Bring this savory bread pudding to the Thanksgiving table instead of the same old stuffing. Featuring rich oat-milky bread and maple-caramelized leeks, this dish, from my book “Big Vegan Flavor” (Avery Books, 2024), also hits all the weekend brunch notes: creamy with crunchy and chewy bits throughout plus cheesy, sweet-and-salty, buttery flavors. As my sister has said on many occasions, “This is one of the most delicious things I’ve ever put in my mouth.” If you prefer a crunchy texture with just a few soft pieces, use a sourdough baguette instead of a loaf or boule-style bread. If you can’t find vegan Parm, it’s still great without it.",
