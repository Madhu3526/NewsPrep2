  "text": "Made tonight, and we loved it. I haven't seen my husband go after food like that in forever. Keeping prior reviews in mind, I used a large Le Creuset risotto pot instead of my 12\" cast iron skillet. It would have been an overflowing mess. I used a 28 oz can of plum tomatoes and no extra water, and tossed in 1/2 C of good Chianti I was drinking while cooking because the pot and I deserved it. This is a hearty, warm dish that will soothe your senses and your soul. My house still smells amazing.\n\nIs this helpful? 284",
