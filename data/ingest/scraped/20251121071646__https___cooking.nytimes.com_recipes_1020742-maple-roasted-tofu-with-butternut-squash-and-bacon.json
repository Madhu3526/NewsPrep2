  "title": "Maple-Roasted Tofu With Butternut Squash and Bacon Recipe",
  "text": "I have made this both vegan and with bacon. Liquid smoke is effective but does not provide the richness of the fat. I'd add coconut butter to the vegan. Pressing the tofu is more effective than paper towels (but most know that). Brilliant flavors, fantastic recipe, don't skimp on the maple syrup or the oil (sesame is a recommended substitution for half the olive oil). Pumpkin instead of butternut should work well - I'll probably try that next.\n\nIs this helpful? 1",
