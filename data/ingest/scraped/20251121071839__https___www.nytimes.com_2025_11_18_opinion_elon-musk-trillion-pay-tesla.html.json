  "title": "Elon Musk Can’t Possibly Deserve His $1 Trillion Payday - The New York Times",
  "text": "If it is a coincidence, it is an era-defining one that the president of the United States is in competition with the world’s richest person for the title of most shameless public figure. Tesla shareholders agreed this month to award the company’s chief executive, Elon Musk, an absurd $1 trillion pay package. Tesla has all the trappings of a big public corporation, but laws, corporate procedures and governance structures seem to have more often enabled rather than checked Mr. Musk, who appears to relish transcending the limits of reason and seemliness.\n\nSo far, this approach has worked for him, to put it mildly.\n\nIt is hard to imagine that Mr. Musk really desires, let alone deserves, such a gargantuan payday. His estimated fortune is well over $450 billion, and his more than 900 million Tesla shares account for about $400 billion of that total. His wealth is already tied to the performance of Tesla’s stock. He has plenty of financial incentive to run Tesla well and for a good long time. You’d think he wouldn’t need any more reasons to stay at the company.\n\nRobyn Denholm, the chairman of Tesla’s board, nevertheless warned shareholders, “If we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision.”\n\nSo Tesla shareholders made history by awarding Mr. Musk an extraordinary new pay plan. To Mr. Musk, the package’s most handsome rewards might be nonpecuniary: his singular status as potentially the first (and only) trillion-dollar chief executive — and perhaps the satisfaction that no one has been able to curb his whims.",
