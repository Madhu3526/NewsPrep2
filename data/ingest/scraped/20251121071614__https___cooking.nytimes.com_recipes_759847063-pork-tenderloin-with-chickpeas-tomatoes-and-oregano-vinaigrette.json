  "text": "I had everything home to make half this recipe, which is perfect, since I live alone and deeply appreciate leftovers. It is so easy and incredibly delicious! I did use the pork tenderloin from Trader Joe’s, which is already seasoned with garlic and cracked pepper, so I only salted and peppered the tomatoes and garbanzo beans before roasting. I roasted everything for 20 minutes, and after 5 minutes of rest, the thickest part of the pork was 150 degrees. I think if I were serving this to guests, I’d sear the tenderloin before roasting, but especially for a weeknight easy dinner, this was great. My cherry tomatoes veered on the larger side, which meant a smaller tomato to pork ratio, but crunchier garbanzo beans, since there was less juice across the pan. I’m out of couscous, so I served it over tri-color quinoa, drizzled with TJ’s creamy vegan dill dressing (SO good), alongside a Greek salad. I can imagine setting down a platter of thinly sliced pork, tomatoes, and garbanzo beans with piles of pita bread and sauces, etc., and let my guests assemble sandwiches. This is a keeper!!!\n\nIs this helpful? 60",
