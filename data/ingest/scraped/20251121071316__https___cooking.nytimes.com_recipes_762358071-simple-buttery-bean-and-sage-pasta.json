  "title": "Simple Buttery Bean and Sage Pasta Recipe",
  "text": "Super adaptable and elemental, this pasta offers rich comfort from butter, autumnal sage and creamy white beans. In this recipe, butter is swirled into water to create a sauce called beurre monté. It’s a delicate sauce, but sturdy enough to bloom the flavors of the sage as well as the garlic and lemon peel. The strips of lemon peel give up their fragrant citrus oils to the dish and provide an attractive garnish, but are not meant to be eaten. Canned beans can be bland, so taste your beans and salt them as necessary before cooking — like you would chicken or steak — so the flavors stick. Beurre monté adds lushness and seasoning, but rich sauces like these don’t penetrate as well as salted water or broth, so don’t skip salting early. Grated Parmesan is a welcome topping for the final dish, and a side of roasted broccolini would also do well here.",
