She is also the host of Hell or High Water: When Disaster Hits Home , a podcast from Vox Media and Audible Originals.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nGoogle debuted a new and improved AI weather model today that will be incorporated into popular products like Search, Gemini, and Pixel phones.\n\nThe company’s AI-enhanced forecasts have proven themselves to be quite accurate so far. AI weather models have also been able to make predictions faster and more efficiently than conventional physics-based models. Until now, Google’s work in this area has been mostly experimental. Now, it’s making those predictions a selling point for Google products and services.\n\n“We’re taking it out of the lab and really putting it into the hands of users”\n\n“We’re taking it out of the lab and really putting it into the hands of users in more ways than we have before and sort of shedding off the experimental kind of designation because we have confidence that our forecasts are really quite effective and quite useful,” Peter Battaglia, senior director of research and sustainability at Google DeepMind, said in a briefing with reporters.\n\nThe new AI model, WeatherNext 2, can generate forecasts eight times faster than Google’s previous model, and is also more accurate in predicting 99.9 percent of variables like temperature or wind. WeatherNext 2 can pump out hundreds of potential outcomes from a particular starting point. It takes less than a minute using one of Google’s TPU chips to make a prediction, which the company says would typically take several hours to accomplish using physics-based models on a supercomputer.\n\nThose conventional models are computationally intensive because they’re essentially attempting to re-create the complicated physics of the atmosphere to produce forecasts. AI models, in contrast, try to discern patterns out of historical weather data in order to predict future outcomes.\n\nGoogle was able to streamline its process by using a strategy it calls a Functional Generative Network (FGN) in WeatherNext 2. Older AI weather models still required repeated processing to generate one forecast. FGN is more efficient because it incorporates noise — or targeted randomness — into the model each time it’s provided an input so that WeatherNext 2 can generate many different possible outcomes in a single step.\n\nThe advancements allow WeatherNext 2 to make predictions up to 15 days in advance and generate hourly forecasts. Google’s banking on that appealing to enterprise customers as well as individual consumers.\n\n“We found that energy, agriculture, transportation, logistics, and customers in many other industries are quite interested in these one-hour steps. It helps them make more precise decisions relating to things that affect their business,” Akib Uddin, a product manager at Google Research, said on the call.\n\nAside from adding WeatherNext 2 to Maps, Search, Gemini, and Pixel Weather, Google is also offering an early access program for customers interested in custom modeling. The forecast data is also available in Google Earth Engine for geospatial analysis and BigQuery for large-scale data analysis.\n\nGoogle has competition, of course, when it comes to figuring out how to make generative AI useful in weather forecasting. The European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, Nvidia, Huawei, and other companies are similarly developing their own AI weather models.",
