  "text": "For example, while cooking in the kitchen, you can ask,\n\n“Alexa, play my favourite artist,”\n\nand Alexa+ will start playing it on your nearby Echo Show. As you move to the living room, just say,\n\n“Alexa, move the music here”\n\nand it continues seamlessly. You can also say, “Alexa, play CBC News everywhere,” to fill your home with sound, or\n\n“Alexa, show me the front door,”\n\nto check your Ring camera and see if that package made it through the snowstorm.",
