The 25-year-old contestant had earlier in November walked out of a pageant event after an official publicly berated her in front of dozens of contestants and threatened to disqualify those who supported her. A week after, two judges resigned, with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the competition. Miss Universe, founded in the US, is one of the longest-running beauty pageants on the planet. The recent controversies, analysts say, underscore the cultural and strategic differences between the pageant's Thai and Mexican owners.\n\nThe pageant saw Thailand's Praveenar Singh place second while the rest of the top five included Venezuela, the Philippines and Cote d'Ivoire. Thailand is hosting Miss Universe for the fourth time and its delegate this year was considered a frontrunner by fan websites. The crowning of the new Miss Universe, the 74th since 1952, signals the resolve of an organisation to stay relevant and evolve from a once-a-year television spectacle to a media brand that is ready for TikTok.\n\nEPA Thailand's Pravennar Singh was a fan favourite to win the crown\n\nDrama in Bangkok\n\nThe pageant events are being organised by Thai media mogul Nawat Itsaragrasil, who is known to fans as the founder and owner of Miss Grand International, a smaller Thai-based contest that is known for its loud social media presence. Mr Nawat holds the licence to host this year's Miss Universe pageant, while the organisation is being run out of Mexico by businessman Raul Rocha. North, Central and South American queens dominated the contest in its early years, but recent decades have seen the rise of fandoms in South East Asia, most especially in Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia, where pageant crowns have become a way out of poverty or an express pass for girls dreaming of becoming a celebrity. But things took a dramatic turn at a pre-pageant ceremony early this month, when Mr Nawat told off Miss Mexico, Fatima Bosch, in front of dozens of contestants for failing to post promotional content. When she objected, Mr Nawat called security and threatened to disqualify those supporting her. Ms Bosch then left the room and others joined her in solidarity. The Miss Universe Organisation condemned Mr Nawat's behaviour as \"malicious\" and Mr Rocha, speaking by video from Mexico, told his Thai business partner to just \"stop\". Mr Nawat later apologised and claimed that some of his words were misunderstood - but a delegation of international executives were sent to take over running the competition.\n\nWatch: Miss Universe contestants stage walkout after organiser berates Miss Mexico\n\nA week later, two judges resigned with one of them accusing organisers of rigging the selection process. Lebanese-French musician Omar Harfouch, who announced his resignation from the eight-member jury on Instagram, alleged that an \"impromptu jury\" had pre-selected finalists ahead of the final on Friday. Hours later, former French football star Claude Makelele also announced he'd pulled out, citing \"unforeseen personal reasons\". The Miss Universe Organisation rejected Mr Harfouch's claims, saying that \"no external group has been authorised to evaluate delegates or select finalists\". It suggested that Mr Harfouch may have been referring to the Beyond the Crown programme - a \"social impact initiative\" that operates independently from the main Miss Universe competition, and has a separate selection committee. Then during the preliminary evening gown round on Wednesday night, Miss Jamaica accidentally fell onstage and had to be rushed out of the theatre in a stretcher. She is recovering in hospital.\n\nTurbulence at the top\n\nThe string of controversies comes as Miss Universe transitions to a new leadership after Thai transgender media mogul Anne Jakrajutatip resigned as CEO just before the pre-pageant events and was replaced by Guatemalan diplomat Mario Bucaro. Ms Jakrajutatip acquired the pageant from US entertainment company Endeavor in 2022. She made sweeping changes towards inclusivity, allowing transgender women, married women and women with children to participate. She also scrapped the age cap for contestants. As audiences declined over the years, she sought to monetise the Miss Universe brand, stamping it on merchandise such as bottled water and bags. In 2023, her entertainment company JKN, filed for bankruptcy, citing \"liquidity problems\".\n\nGetty Images Former owner Anne Jakrajutatip sought to make Miss Universe more inclusive\n\nBefore she resigned, Ms Jakrajutatip brought in Mr Rocha from Mexico as business partner and later tapped Mr Nawat to organise the 2025 pageant. It has been a \"very rocky transition\" for the pageant's leadership, Dani Walker, an American beauty queen and pageant coach told the BBC. She said important roles were now split between leaders in Bangkok and Mexico. The leadership structure was much clearer when the pageant was being run by Endeavor, and before that, Donald Trump, she said. \"For fans and outsiders, it's very confusing. No one knows who the real leaders are or who to ask when they have questions, and that's very damaging to the brand,\" Paula Shugart, who served as Miss Universe Organization president under the previous two owners, told the BBC. Thitiphong Duangkhong, a scholar of women's and Latin American studies and an expert on beauty pageants, said those behind the pageant should be aware of their cultural differences. \"In our country, we use the Thai language to communicate with our fellow Thais. We understand the social context, we understand social structure, we understand the inequality of power in society, and we constantly try to negotiate with it using the Thai language,\" he told the BBC. Mr Thitiphong said Ms Jakrajutatip being a transwoman might not have sat well with some Latin American fans who subscribe to macho culture. \"There's talk of women who aren't women suddenly buying a pageant that's supposed to be about women's entertainment. What's going to happen?\"\n\nWhat's next for Miss Universe?\n\nFor years, audiences for the Miss Universe broadcast have been declining steadily as fans to shift on social media. On TikTok and Instagram, former titleholders, even runners up, maintain accounts with millions of followers, transforming them into influencers. It is in this e-commerce universe that Mr Nawat's Miss Grand International queens are expected to embrace - selling merchandise in live broadcasts - which he tried to introduce to Miss Universe. But on the Latin American side, beauty queens are still regarded as glamorous television celebrities. A Miss Universe reality show was even staged for that audience and the winner - a Dominican crowned Miss Universe Latina - is competing in the main pageant in Bangkok.\n\nGetty Images 'Miss Universe is worthless if you don't empower and support the women who compete,' says its former president",
