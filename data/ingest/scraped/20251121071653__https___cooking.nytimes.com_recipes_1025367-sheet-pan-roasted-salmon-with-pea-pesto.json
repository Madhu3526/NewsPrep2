  "text": "Peas, one of the highlights of spring produce, make for a delightfully sweet and bright pesto. Lemon juice, garlic, basil and almonds join the peas as they are blitzed with olive oil, creating a creamy pesto paste. Fresh peas can be used, but frozen peas work especially well, so use what's left in that bag in the back of your freezer. Feel free to swap the almonds for a different nut or the basil for different herbs, and add grated Parmesan if you like. Pea pesto is particularly delicious drizzled on this simple, easy meal of roasted salmon and potatoes, which cooks in the oven while you make the pesto. Feel free to use any extra pea pesto on, well, everything.",
