  "text": "The first time Mwezi Mugerwa saw the African golden cat, he didn’t know what it was.\n\nWhile reviewing camera trap footage at Uganda’s Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park, the conservation biologist spotted an unfamiliar creature around twice the size of a domestic cat in the grainy black-and-white footage.\n\nNone of his colleagues could identify it; “but, when I talked to the hunters and communities who lived around the park, they knew the species,” Mugerwa recalls.\n\nKnown as Embaka in the local language, the “cryptic” golden cat was often caught accidentally in forest snares.\n\n“That was really concerning for me — that we may lose this species before we even get to know about it,” says Mugerwa.\n\nA captive African golden cat in an enclosure in Uganda.

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the world’s largest environmental network of government and society organizations, tracks threatened wildlife.\n\n“They’re really, really difficult to see in the wild,” says Mugerwa, who won the Indianapolis Prize Emerging Conservationist Award earlier this year for his work on the species.\n\nBut, realizing that accurately counting the big cats was the first step to protecting them, he set out to conduct the first population census across the species’ range, expected to publish next year.\n\nCounting cats\n\nMugerwa knew that gathering data on the African golden cat wasn’t something he could do on his own. So, in 2019, he founded the African Golden Cat Conservation Alliance (AGCCA), a network of 46 conservationists across 19 countries.\n\nTogether, they launched a standardized camera trap survey across the cat’s suspected range, supported by funding from the National Geographic Society.\n\nBut manually reviewing thousands of images from 30 sites across 19 countries — the largest camera trap grid for any African wildlife species, says Mugerwa — “was really, really painful.”\n\nA camera trap captures rare footage of an African golden cat in the wild.

In Uganda and Gabon, for example, surveys found just 16 individuals per 100 square kilometers.\n\nThe surveys have also revealed the true impact of poaching: in areas with hunting restrictions, Mugerwa says cat populations were up to 50% higher, with wider distribution. The study has also observed that while the cats are active both day and night, many are strictly nocturnal — likely to avoid human activity during the day, he adds.\n\nCommunity action\n\nWildlife biologist Mwezi Mugerwa fits a camera trap to a tree.

Early in his research, Mugerwa realized that hunting was the cat’s primary threat.\n\nIn East Africa, where Mugerwa is based, the African golden cat is rarely the target of hunters. But bushmeat snares, set for pigs and antelopes, are indiscriminate, often catching other species unintentionally. In 2019, Mugerwa received reports of 80 golden cats caught in snares in three Ugandan forests, 88% of which were accidental.\n\n“We are dealing with a bushmeat crisis: the level of hunting ongoing in this forest is unsustainable and out of control,” he says, adding: “The species is being pushed to the edge of extinction in many of its range countries.”\n\nTo combat the cat’s biggest threat, Mugerwa went directly to the residents, creating Embaka: the first community-based anti-poaching conservation project focused on the African golden cat.\n\nWorking with over 8,000 families across the cat’s range, including Gabon, Angola, the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, and Uganda, the project engages local communities — many of whom are former poachers — to deploy camera traps and report sightings.\n\n“We have learned a lot from local communities; the range expansion, for instance, some of that data comes from hunters,” says Mugerwa. Embaka offers incentives like dental care and livestock support to encourage communities to “speak out against hunting” and protect the forest ecosystem.\n\nBringing reformed hunters on board not only reduces the threat the cats will face from hunting, but it also “improves the relationship between the African golden cat and the communities,” says Mugerwa.\n\n“It also allows the local communities to own and to be part of the camera trap grid, which is really beautiful to see,” he adds.",
