  "text": "Journalist Zeinab Badawi heads to Athens to celebrate the marking of the centenary of the birth of the Greek-American opera soprano Maria Callas, hailed as the best soprano of her age and certainly one of the greatest singers in operatic history.\n\nAs famous for her colourful romantic life as for her talent, she was portrayed as a 'prima donna' by the media. They relentlessly published details of her personal life including her difficult relationship with her mother and her affair with the Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis, who humiliated her by marrying former US first lady Jackie Kennedy.\n\nZeinab explores how far Maria Callas' early life and training in Greece shaped her sensational career and finds out how far she remains an icon for young singers today.",
