  "text": "A fried pepper condiment of puréed bell peppers and onions known in Yorùbá as ọbẹ ata dín dín is common across West Africa as a base for stewed greens and meat. This sauce is an expression of balance in a pot, often packed with fresh, dried, fermented and hot ingredients, each rich and distinct in flavor. Here, mushrooms and chicken thighs are the lucky recipients of this mother sauce. The pivot is to simply chop jarred roasted peppers instead of crushing fresh vegetables with a grinding stone, which is a traditional yet lengthy process. Oil-packed anchovies and miso deliver exactly as expected, adding savoriness to the depth of mushrooms. A splash of vinegar lends a tart zing to the sauce; a scatter of chopped basil adds a piquant burst.",
