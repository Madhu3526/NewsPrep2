  "text": "Performers and visitors to the famous gothic cathedral in the midst of the River Seine may find some subtle differences to the way sound bounces around its walls.\n\nThe Cathedral of Notre-Dame de Paris has borne witness to many turning points in history. The building's striking gothic stonework has stood sentry on an island in the midst of the River Seine since the late 12th Century as coronations, wars and revolutions have unfolded in its shadow. What you might not realise, however, is that the cathedral has played a key part in shaping the music you hear when you turn on the radio or stream a playlist.\n\nNotre-Dame was, for a brief time, the beating heart of a musical revolution – one that changed music forever and laid the foundations for many of the songs we listen to today.\n\nUp until the middle of the 12th Century in Medieval Europe, it was common to hear the haunting melodic chants of the clergy echoing through churches and cathedrals. Gregorian chant, or plainsong, was the musical style of the day, where sacred texts were sung either by a single voice or a choir in unison – something known as monophony.\n\nBut faced with the Notre-Dame's soaring nave, ribbed vaults and towering columns, a group of composers began to try something different to take advantage of the way sound rattled around inside the building. They introduced multiple lines of melody simultaneously to produce elaborate polyphonic arrangements, or motets – the early beginnings of a musical texture that is a common feature in modern music, from jazz to pop and hip-hop.",
