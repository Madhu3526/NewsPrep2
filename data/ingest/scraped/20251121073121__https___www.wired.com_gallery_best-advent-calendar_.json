  "text": "Which are The best Advent calendars? All of them, I think. There's something undeniably exciting about them. To me, they were the first example of a little treat. I'd get done with a hard day of being an 8-year-old and come home to crack open a cardboard door to eat some powdery chocolate the way a sitcom dad makes a beeline for his post-work or lawn-mower beer. As an adult, spending just a moment every single day with a special little treat or gift can help you stop feeling overwhelmed by all the tree trimming and gift wrapping and societal breakdowns—enough so you can start enjoying the ride.\n\nAdvent calendars are cooler now than they ever were when I was a kid, and the contents aren't limited to novelty Santa-shaped chocolates anymore. I painstakingly tore into several cardboard doors to get to the bottom of the best Advent calendars. My favorites are below. Even if you start cracking into your calendar after December 1, don’t worry; a lot of Advent calendars are just 12 days. Plus, who needs rules? Just double up on treats if you start late!\n\nBe sure to check out our other gift guides, including the Best Gifts for Newlyweds, the Best Gifts for Bird Lovers, Best Fake Christmas Trees, and the Best Gifts for Golfers.\n\nUpdated November 2025: We've added 11 new Advent calendars to this guide, removed any sold-out options, and ensured up-to-date links and prices.",
