  "text": "Step 3\n\nAdd the butter to the pot with the cooked and drained potatoes. Using a wooden spoon, crush the potatoes against the sides of the pot. Pour in a third of the garlicky cream and gently stir until the potatoes have absorbed it. Repeat until there is no more cream left, then stir in the labneh, taste and season with more salt. If you’re not a fan of lumps, feel free to use a masher or whisk to further mash the potatoes.",
