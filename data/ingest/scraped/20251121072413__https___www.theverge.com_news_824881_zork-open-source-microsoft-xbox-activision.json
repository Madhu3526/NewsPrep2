  "text": "Microsoft makes Zork open-source.\n\nThe original Zork I, Zork II, and Zork III games are now available under the MIT license. Microsoft, Xbox, and Activision have teamed up to preserve the clever Z-Machine engine that powered the Zork games and allow students, teachers, and developers to study the code and learn from it. Microsoft has also worked with Jason Scott, from the Internet Archive, to grant this open-source license.",
