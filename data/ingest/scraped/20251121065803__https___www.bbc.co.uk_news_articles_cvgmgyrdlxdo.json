  "title": "Strictly Come Dancing: Star arrested on suspicion of rape",
  "text": "The newspaper says the woman was not a contestant or professional dancer on the show, but had met the man due to his participation in the competition.\n\nIn a statement, Hertfordshire Police said: \"A man was released on police bail under investigation having been arrested in London on Monday 13 October on suspicion of rape.\"\n\nThe police force said the allegations related to an incident which happened in Hertfordshire.\n\n\"Meanwhile inquiries by officers from Hertfordshire Constabulary's Public Protection team will continue.\n\n\"Given the nature of the allegations, it would be inappropriate to make any further comment at this time.\"\n\nIt comes after another man involved with the hit BBC dance show was also arrested on suspicion of rape in August.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police said the man was also suspected of \"non-consensual intimate image abuse\".\n\nIt is not known what role that individual had in the programme.\n\nStrictly, which has aired since 2004 and is predominantly filmed at Elstree Studios, has faced multiple controversies over the past few years relating to the behaviour of some of its professionals and celebrity guests.\n\nSeparately, the BBC launched an investigation earlier this year into alleged drug use by two of the show's stars, who have not been named.\n\nIn August, the Met said it was investigating allegations of drug use on the hit dance show.",
