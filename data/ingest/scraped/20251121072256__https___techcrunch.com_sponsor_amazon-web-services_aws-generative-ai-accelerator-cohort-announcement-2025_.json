  "text": "Introducing the 40 startups selected from around the world for the 2025 AWS Generative AI Accelerator\n\nMeet the next generation of startups from across the globe expanding the scope of what’s possible with generative AI and AWS.\n\nAWS is proud to announce the 40 startups participating in the 2025 global AWS Generative AI Accelerator Cohort. This initiative is a key part of our $230 million commitment to enrich the landscape of generative AI by fostering the next generation of pioneers, helping them turn ambitious ideas into transformative solutions that shape the future of technology.\n\nThe program kicks off October 14 at our Amazon HQ in Seattle with learning, mentorship, and leadership from AWS domain experts as well as a curated network of industry leaders and experts from top AI companies. It all concludes with a showcase at AWS re:Invent in Las Vegas, NV in December.\n\n“Whether it’s in biotech labs, creative studios, or industrial applications, the pace of generative AI is extraordinary, and it’s happening everywhere,” says Sherry Karamdashti, General Manager & Head of Startups in North America at AWS. “This year’s Cohort reinforces our mission to help that innovation move fast and deliver real-world impact for customers in every industry. We’re removing the barriers and acceleration opportunities so these leaders can grow their world-changing solutions.”\n\n40 bold, visionary startups were selected from a field of thousands of applicants spanning every corner of the globe. With an acceptance rate of less than 2%, a diverse committee of AWS startup experts and program partners chose the Cohort for the strength of their ideas, technical readiness, and interview performance.\n\nSupporting the new AI vanguard\n\nStartups participating in the program each receive up to $1 million in AWS credits to fuel their development and scaling needs, as well as go-to-market support, and business and technical mentorship.\n\nPresenting the 40 AWS Generative AI Accelerator program participants\n\nAsia Pacific\n\nHyperbots | Industry: Financial Services | Location: India\n\nHyperbots helps CFOs with over 90% productivity gain for end-end finance processes with their agentic AI F&A platform powered by HyperLM, the first ever F&A LLM.\n\nMary Technology | Industry: Legal Technology| Location: Australia\n\nMary Technology helps law firms & internal legal teams understand the facts locked inside of documents using their world-leading fact management system.\n\nRLWRLD | Industry: Computers & Electronics | Location: South Korea\n\nRLWRLD helps industrial leaders automate complex physical tasks by providing real-world robotics foundation models built on high-precision dexterity and industry data.\n\nSCB 10X | Industry: Fintech | Location: Thailand\n\nTyphoon unlocks Thai language understanding with open-source multimodal language models and tools optimized for Thai developers, researchers and businesses.\n\nSDio | Industry: Software & Internet | Location: Japan\n\nSDio transforms long-duration videos into searchable intelligence using AI built for deep, multi-stream analysis.\n\nSmallest AI | Industry: Software & Internet | Location: India\n\nSmallest AI builds foundational Voice AI models to automate real-time communications in enterprise contact centers.\n\nStimuler | Industry: Education | Location: India\n\nStimuler is a voice AI app to help billions of non-native speakers become fluent in English, primarily via speaking instead of studying it.\n\nSyntheticGestalt | Industry: Life Sciences | Location: Japan\n\nSyntheticGestalt helps life science companies accelerate scientific discovery by providing them with the world’s largest molecular-focused foundation AI model.\n\nTrillion Labs | Industry: Software & Internet | Location: South Korea\n\nTrillion Labs is advancing AI with cutting-edge language models for Korean and Asian languages that bridge cultures and redefine what’s possible.\n\nLatin America\n\nAI Cube | Industry: Software & Internet | Location: Brazil\n\nAI Cube delivers no-code AI automation to streamline tasks and enhance efficiency.
