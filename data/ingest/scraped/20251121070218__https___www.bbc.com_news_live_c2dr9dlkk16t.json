  "text": "'If you see someone stuck, you give them a push'\n\nFarmer Jack Hallam has been helping out his community near Egton Bridge, west of Whitby.\n\nHe says: “It’s pretty grim, it’s blizzarding. There’s about five inches of snow and it’s coming down heavy.\n\n“It snowed through the night and at about 06:30 GMT, we were out on the road.\n\n\"All the farmers are out ploughing and gritting but it’s a bit of a fighting battle for them because as fast as they plough, it’s coming down.\"\n\nThe farmer adds his efforts are just \"part of living in a village\".\n\n“Where we are, the winter is pretty bleak but you just help out,\" he says.\n\n\"If you see someone stuck in a village, you give them a pull or a push.”",
