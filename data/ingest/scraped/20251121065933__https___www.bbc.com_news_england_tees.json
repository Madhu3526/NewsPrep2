It's very humbling,\" he told BBC Radio Tees.\n\nViveash was assistant to Mark Robins at Coventry City for seven years and before that he worked at Chelsea's academy, but it is the first time the 56-year-old has been in charge of a senior team.\n\nAnd having had a season out between Coventry and his arrival at Boro in the summer with Edwards, he is appreciating the chance at the Riverside.\n\n\"I'm just somebody who's had an ability to help players and I love coaching,\" he said.\n\n\"I love working with players on the grass. I had 11 months out of the game so I've certainly cherished every moment of this last week because it's been really interesting and I've really enjoyed it.\n\n\"When you're out of the game, those are the times you miss - on the training ground with the players, trying to get that extra 1% out of them.\n\n\"So it's humbling, I'm working at a fantastic club for an outstanding chairman.\"",
