  "title": "100 dishes in 40 days: India's epic wedding feast",
  "text": "For more than 700 years, an extraordinary tradition has been maintained in southern India, where grooms are presented with a parade of freshly prepared dishes by their new mother-in-law.\n\nIndia is renowned for opulent multi-day weddings packed with extravagant feasts. But of all the nation's matrimonial customs, perhaps none is as unique – or delicious – as Puyyappla Perukkal; a centuries-old Mappila Muslim tradition from the Keralan city of Thalassery.\n\nRenowned for its cardamom, pepper and clove production, Thalassery is a rather unassuming seaside city that was once one of the hubs of the global spice trade. Before the British established Thalassery as their first settlement along south-western India's Malabar Coast in 1683, Portuguese navigators and Dutch traders had vied for its control. In the centuries since, a blend of Arabian, Persian, Dutch, British, and Indian influences have come together to create one of India's most diverse gastronomic melting pots – and some of its most mouth-watering dishes.\n\nBut of the many cultures who have left their gastronomical mark on the city, perhaps none is as distinct as the Mappila Muslims, who have maintained an astonishing matrimonial tradition that is believed to have endured since the 13th Century.",
