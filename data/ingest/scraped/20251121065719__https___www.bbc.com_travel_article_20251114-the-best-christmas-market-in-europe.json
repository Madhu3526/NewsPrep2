  "text": "After years of sweating through summer festivities in Australia, one family swapped sunscreen for snow – and found festive bliss in an unexpected European capital.\n\nTimber chalets were festooned with twinkling lights, a merry-go-round twirled gracefully and the smoky scent of grilling sausages drew us deeper into the town square. It was Christmas market season and our family of four was ready to indulge.\n\nEvery year, we celebrate Christmas in blazing heat, downing roast dinners and plum pudding with slicked brows and sticky backs. With the festive season squarely in the middle of the Australian summer, we have little choice. While the thought of such warmth might appeal to some, we had long hankered for a wintery Christmas. With our eldest offspring now officially an adult, it was now or never. We packed our winter woolies and boarded the long flight from Melbourne to London.\n\nThe plan: a train journey through seven countries and eight cities, with time to enjoy every Christmas market along the way.\n\nFinding the feuerzangenbowle\n\nTo travel is to eat. It’s a motto our family lives by, and one that often dictates where we go. Christmas presented a particularly tasty opportunity. We wrote down lists of regional dishes we wanted to try in each city and never tired of tracking them down.",
