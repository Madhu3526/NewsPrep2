  "text": "TechCrunch was proud to host Google Cloud at Disrupt 2025 in San Francisco. Here’s an overview of their Builders Stage session.\n\nGenerative AI is changing how startups build and scale—it’s not just about a different platform; it’s a different playbook. Darren Mowry (VP, Global Startups, Google Cloud) and Tulsee Doshi (Sr. Director, Product, Google DeepMind) explored how the next wave of AI companies built on Google. They showed how Google Cloud’s integrated AI stack—from advanced models and developer tools to global infrastructure—gave startups a launchpad, not a puzzle. With insights from DeepMind’s research and Tulsee’s product perspective, attendees saw how Google helped AI-native startups move faster from prototype to production.\n\nPresented by:",
