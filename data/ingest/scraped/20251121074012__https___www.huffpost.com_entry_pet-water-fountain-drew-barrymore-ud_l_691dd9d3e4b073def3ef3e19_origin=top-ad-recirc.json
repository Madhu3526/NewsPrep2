  "text": "“I got this water fountain for my dogs and it has been working really well. It holds plenty of water, stays clean, and is very quiet. The design is simple and looks nice in the house. It is also easy to clean. I would definitely buy it again.” — LLee206\n\n“I have two cats who drink a lot of water. We don’t have a ton of space so I was looking for a fountain we didn’t have to refill daily. I love the look of this one and it’s big enough to hold a good amount of water!” — ALO0031\n\n“This drinking fountain has been amazing for my kitty! She has been enjoying getting her fresh water at any time and what I like the most is the height and depth of the fountain. The removable faucet is also pretty neat as it helps with keeping the filtration system clean at all times.” — YolaA.\n\n“I pet sit and have a Great Pyrenees myself. I was constantly filling the water dish. This has been a game-changer. It’s easy to set up, use and clean. Highly recommend.” — Radscribe",
