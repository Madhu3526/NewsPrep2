  "text": "The browser wars are heating up again, this time with AI in the driver’s seat.\n\nOpenAI just launched Atlas, a ChatGPT-powered browser that lets users surf the web using natural language, and even includes an “agent mode” that can complete tasks autonomously. It’s one of the biggest browser launches in recent memory, but it’s debuting with an unsolved security flaw that could expose passwords, emails, and sensitive data.\n\nWatch as Max Zeff, Anthony Ha, and Sean O’Kane break down Atlas’ debut, the broader wave of alternative browsers, the AWS crash that broke much of the internet, and more of the week’s startup and tech news on TechCrunch’s Equity podcast.\n\nSubscribe to Equity on Apple Podcasts, Overcast, Spotify and all the casts. You also can follow Equity on X and Threads, at @EquityPod.",
