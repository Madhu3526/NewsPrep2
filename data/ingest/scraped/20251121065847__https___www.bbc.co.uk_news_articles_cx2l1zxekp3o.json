  "text": "We all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day.\n\nThat's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone - creeps into everyday moments.\n\nThis can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones.\n\nRather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist.\n\nDr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else.",
