His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nLucid Motors revealed pricing and reservation details for its upcoming Gravity SUV, which is expected to go into production later this year.\n\nTo start out, Lucid will sell two trims of the Gravity: the Touring and Grand Touring. The Grand Touring will start at $94,900 and will be the first to go into production in late 2024. The Gravity Touring model, which starts at $79,900, won’t go into production until late 2025.\n\nLucid is opening orders for the Gravity on November 7th. Existing Lucid customers will be given priority for taking delivery. And all customers will be able to design, configure, and order their vehicle on Lucid’s website.\n\nLucid didn’t provide any details about delivery charges or incentives. The company has applied a $7,500 discount on its Air sedan to make up for the fact that its vehicles don’t qualify for the federal EV tax credit. (Lucid’s vehicles are too pricey for the credit, which only applies to sedans that cost less than $55,000 and SUVs and trucks priced under $80,000.)\n\nWhen it was announced last year, Lucid said the SUV would get up to 440 miles of range, offer 800 horsepower, and accelerate 0–60 mph in under 3.5 seconds. The Gravity will also be the first vehicle from Lucid to come with a native NACS charging port that’s compatible with Tesla’s Supercharger network.",
