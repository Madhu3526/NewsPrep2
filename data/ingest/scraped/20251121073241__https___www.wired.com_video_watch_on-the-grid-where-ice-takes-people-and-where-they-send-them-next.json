  "text": "Transcript\n\nSince January, ICE has made more than 100,000 arrests,\n\ndouble compared to last year,\n\nleading to over 60,000 migrants currently in detention.\n\nNearly 70% of them don't have a criminal conviction.\n\nThe White House set a quota of 3,000 arrests per day,\n\nand ICE's budget is now 170 billion,\n\nwith plans to double the force to about 20,000.\n\nImmigration has become the centerpiece\n\nof the Trump administration.\n\nIn this video, we'll track\n\nwhere migrants are being arrested,\n\nwhere exactly they're locked up,\n\nand where they're getting deported to.\n\nWired tracked the data.\n\nThis is Immigration and Customs Enforcement On The Grid.\n\n[Cop 1] Move out the way!\n\n[Cop 2] Move back, move back!\n\nFirst, let's level set.\n\nFrom January to June of 2024,\n\nunder former President Joe Biden, ICE carried out\n\nabout 49,000 arrests.\n\nIn that same timeframe in 2025,\n\nnow under President Trump, the number of arrests has surged\n\nby about 122%.\n\nSo where in America is this happening?\n\nTexas alone represented about 23.2%\n\nof all arrests nationwide.\n\nFlorida followed with about 11%, California with 7%,\n\nGeorgia with 4%, and Arizona with 3%.\n\nThe day he entered office,\n\nTrump scrapped Biden's policy that protected schools,\n\nhospitals, churches, and courthouses.\n\nSince then, ICE can operate in virtually any public space,\n\nmaking everywhere fair game.\n\nWe've all seen images\n\nof ICE agents lurking in the hallways of courthouses waiting\n\nto arrest migrants when they step out of their hearings.\n\n[Speaker] Oh God, oh God.\n\n[speaker speaking Spanish]\n\nThis type of raid happens frequently here\n\nat 26 Federal Plaza in New York City.\n\nAsylum claims and deportation hearings are held here,\n\nbut it's a catch 22 for many.\n\nBy showing up for your court hearing, you risk arrest,\n\nand by skipping it, you risk deportation.\n\nWork site raids are at an all time high.\n\nIndividuals accused of entering the country illegally\n\nat a Hyundai plant in Ellabel, Georgia were arrested.\n\nMany were from South Korea.\n\nIt was one of the largest single site operations\n\nin the agency's history.\n\nBut the fallout from the raid\n\nhas basically caused a diplomatic crisis with South Korea\n\nbecause most of the people working there\n\nwere not here illegally.\n\nTop industries employing undocumented immigrants\n\ninclude food services, waste management, manufacturing,\n\nagriculture, healthcare, transportation, warehousing\n\nand educational services.\n\nAnd at the top of the list,\n\nthe industry, perhaps the hardest hit is construction.\n\nAt a construction site in Mobile, Alabama, it was reported\n\nthat fears of a raid caused about half the workforce\n\nto stay away, delaying the completion\n\nof an 84,000 square foot recreation center.\n\nThis chilling effect has also largely impacted\n\nthe agriculture industry.\n\nFarmers have said that ICE raids in their areas\n\nhave driven workers away.\n\nIn California, where about a third of America's vegetables\n\nand three quarters of its fruits are grown,\n\nroughly half of the state's farm workers lack legal status.\n\nIn Ventura County, an agricultural hub\n\nthat generates billions of dollars annually,\n\nmuch of the crop is harvested\n\nby undocumented immigrant labor.\n\nA recent study estimated that a reduction\n\nof the agricultural workforce by 20 to 40%\n\nwould result in an estimated three to $7 billion\n\nin lost crops\n\nand driving produce prices up by anywhere\n\nfrom five to 12%.\n\nOnce arrested, but before they're locked up\n\nin a detainment facility,\n\na migrant is taken to a short-term transfer hub\n\nlike the Dallas Ice Field Office.\n\nOn September 24th,\n\na rooftop gunman opened fire into the Sally Port,\n\nkilling one detainee and critically injuring two others.\n\nICE held 61,226 people in detention facilities,\n\nand ICE is doubling detention capacity,\n\naiming for more than 107,000 detainees\n\nacross 125 facilities.\n\nSo where are these detention centers?\n\nThis map is based on public data\n\nand gives us a good overview\n\nof all the locations across the United States.\n\nThe bulk of the expansion is happening in Texas, California,\n\nGeorgia, and Louisiana.\n\nThe red points are private facilities.\n\nIn fact, according to the American Immigration Council,\n\nthe vast majority\n\nof people held in ICE detention are held in facilities\n\neither owned or operated by private prison companies\n\nsuch as GEO Group or CoreCivic.\n\nAnd business is booming.\n\nICE recently announced a 15 year contract valued\n\nat a billion dollars with GEO Group\n\nto reopen Delaney Hall in Newark, New Jersey.\n\nWith a capacity to hold about 1,000 people,\n\nit will become the largest ICE processing\n\nand detention center on the East Coast.\n\nOver in Texas, we see many private facilities.\n\nAs of August 18th, the state held over 13,000 detainees,\n\nthe most of any state by far.\n\nThat's followed by Louisiana,\n\nCalifornia, Georgia, and Arizona.\n\nHere are some of the top ICE facilities\n\nwith the highest average daily population\n\nas of August 4th, 2025.\n\nFirst up, Adams County Detention Center\n\nin Natchez, Mississippi.\n\nAdams is one of ICE's biggest hubs.\n\nIt averages about 2,100 detainees daily,\n\nthe top in the country, and it's owned\n\nand operated by CoreCivic.\n\nWind Correctional Center in Louisiana is located\n\nin a Gulf Coast region dubbed detention alley,\n\nwhere 14 of the nation's 20 largest\n\nimmigration detention centers are located.\n\nCentral Louisiana Ice Processing Center\n\ngained national attention\n\nfor detaining Columbia student, Mahmoud Khalil.\n\nHe spent 104 days in detention,\n\nand he was released when a federal judge ruled\n\nthat his detention was unconstitutional.\n\nOver at the Moshannon Valley Processing Center\n\nin Pennsylvania, in August,\n\nactivists urged Clearfield County Commissioners\n\nto end the county's contract with ICE and the GEO group\n\nafter a 32-year-old Chinese detainee was found unresponsive\n\nin an apparent hanging.\n\nAnd of course, there's the infamous alligator Alcatraz.\n\nBuilt on the site of abandoned airport\n\nin the Florida Everglades,\n\nthe facility's remote location is indeed surrounded\n\nby alligator infested swamps.\n\nIts supporters tout that as a natural deterrent\n\nthat reduces the need for costly perimeter security.\n\nIn August, a judge blocked the expansion\n\nof alligator Alcatraz,\n\nbut on September 5th, an appeals court reversed\n\nthat decision and as Governor Ron DeSantis put it,\n\nThe facility is now open for business.\n\nMeanwhile, civil rights lawyers are suing saying\n\nthat detainees are denied confidential communication\n\nwith their attorneys, a First Amendment violation.\n\nThese aren't the only accusations ICE has had\n\nover alleged civil rights violations.\n\nRemember Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba,\n\nthe US military prison that earned a reputation\n\nfor human rights abuses\n\nand allegations of torture in post 9/11 war on terror?\n\nAs of July, 2025,\n\nthere were a reported 72 immigrant detainees\n\nfrom 26 countries being held there.\n\nOn August 29th, Human Rights Watch called\n\nfor a halt transferring immigrants to the naval base,\n\ndue to reports that detainees were kept isolated\n\nin unsanitary conditions,\n\nsome detainees even reported attempted suicides.\n\nEloy Federal Contract Facility in Arizona\n\nis run by the private company CoreCivic.\n\nThis is where US representative Yassamin Ansari was blocked\n\nby ICE from oversight visits.\n\nAnsari recently held a press conference for a constituent\n\nof hers who's being held there and has leukemia,\n\nand who she says isn't receiving adequate care.\n\nPoor medical care seems to be a recurring theme.\n\nOn August 31st while in custody\n\nat the Central Arizona Correctional Complex,\n\na 32-year-old man from Mexico died.\n\nA fundraising campaign created by his family states\n\nthat he passed away alone,\n\nlikely from complications related to COVID-19,\n\nwithout receiving the medical attention he deserved.\n\nAccording to freedomformigrants.org,\n\nthere are currently 144 facilities\n\nwith active COVID-19 cases,\n\nand these are just a few of the many reported violations\n\nfrom around the country.\n\nAs of August 24th, 2025, nearly 70.3%\n\nof the more than 60,000 people in ICE detention\n\nhad no criminal conviction.\n\nAnd among those with convictions,\n\nmany were from minor offenses such as traffic violations.\n\nAbout 11% are on an expedited track\n\nfor deportation, which means that they can be removed\n\nfrom the country without a hearing\n\nbefore an immigration judge.\n\nICE has deported nearly 200,000 people\n\nsince Trump returned to office.\n\nAdd to that, almost 150,000 more deportations\n\nfrom US Customs and Border Protections,\n\nand that puts them on track for the highest level\n\nof formal deportations in a decade.\n\nSo how does that compare to other previous presidents?\n\nHere we have Trump's combined total so far,\n\nincluding his first term,\n\nand Biden's Bush's, Clinton's.\n\nBut what about President Obama?\n\nOver the course of his two terms, ICE removals totaled\n\naround 2.4 million undocumented immigrants.\n\nSome sources put that total even higher,\n\nreporting over three million non-citizens removed\n\nduring his presidency, more than any other president.\n\nObama was criticized\n\nfor speedy deportations without full court hearings.\n\nBut after lawsuits and political pushback,\n\nhis administration narrowed enforcement priorities in 2014,\n\nfocusing removals on criminals, security threats,\n\nand recent border crossers.\n\nThe organization Human Rights First\n\nhas tracked more than 40,000 deportation flights\n\nusing public data.\n\nBetween January 20th and August 31st, 2025,\n\nthe Trump administration carried out at least 7,454 flights\n\na big increase versus the same period last year.\n\nIn August, there were an average\n\nof 45 flights a day for a total\n\nof 1,393 immigration enforcement flights.\n\nOf these 240 were flights\n\nthat removed people from the United States,\n\nthe highest monthly total ever recorded\n\nsince tracking began in 2020.\n\nFrom a detention center,\n\ndeportations are carried out by ICE Air Operations,\n\nwhich stages a total of 12 aircraft at its locations,\n\nincluding in Mesa, Arizona,\n\nICE's headquarters for Air Operations, San Antonio\n\nand Brownsville, Texas, Miami, Florida,\n\nand Alexandria, Louisiana, a major hub\n\nwhere the airport actually has a detention center on site.\n\nFlights removing detained migrants from the US\n\nare usually carried out by private charter companies\n\nunder government contract.\n\nRecently, a budget commercial airline Avelo,\n\nsigned a contract to run deportation flights\n\nfrom Mesa using three Boeing 737 aircraft.\n\nThe deal stirred political, ethical safety\n\nand labor concerns from flight attendant unions\n\nand local officials.\n\nSo where are people actually being sent?\n\nIn May of 2025, over half of all deportation flights\n\nwent to Central America's Northern Triangle of El Salvador,\n\nGuatemala, and Honduras.\n\nMexico has received more than 39,000 deportees from the US,\n\nincluding 6,000 who aren't Mexican citizens.\n\nThese arrangements are known as third country deportations.\n\nBut perhaps the most controversial\n\nthird country deportations have been to El Salvador,\n\nwhich hosts migrants in its mega prison, Cecot, notorious\n\nfor its brutal conditions\n\nthat have been condemned by human rights groups.\n\nTrump struck a multimillion dollar deal\n\nwith El Salvadoran President, Nayib Bukele\n\nto send Venezuelan migrants there.\n\nKilmar Abrego-Garcia was among those deported\n\nto El Salvador.\n\nHe was mistakenly deported there under allegations\n\nof belonging to the notorious MS13 gang.\n\nHe was returned in June, but became a symbol of the Trump\n\nadministration's controversial deportation policy.\n\nNow, the Trump administration is seeking\n\nto deport him under new charges,\n\nthis time, to the African nation of Eswatini.\n\nAbrego-Garcia has pleaded not guilty.\n\nAfrican nations have also been drawn\n\ninto third country deportations.\n\nRwanda agreed to take in 250 migrants.\n\nWhile in May, the Trump administration attempted\n\nto send eight men to South Sudan, a country in the middle\n\nof conflict that the State Department deems unsafe\n\nfor Americans to travel to.\n\nThe men were convicted of crimes ranging from murder\n\nto robbery, but had finished or were nearing the end\n\nof their prison sentences.\n\nBut the flight to Sudan never made it.\n\nA judge ruled\n\nthat the detainees hadn't been given a fair chance\n\nto contest their removals, diverting the flight to Djibouti.\n\nOnly one of the men was from South Sudan.\n\nThe others came from Laos, Vietnam, Cuba,\n\nMexico, and Myanmar.\n\nUS officials said\n\nthat their home countries had refused to accept them.\n\nSo this is where we're at right now,\n\nbut things are changing really quickly.\n\nThe kind of money and manpower now flowing into ICE\n\nand to DHS is already radically changing\n\nimmigration enforcement in the US.\n\nBut it's not just immigrant populations\n\nthat are gonna feel this, we all are.\n\nWhether it's the government combining\n\nand combing through all of our data\n\nin ways that have never happened before,\n\nor restrictions on government services\n\nto people who might have immigrants in their families\n\nor increased surveillance,\n\nor the weaponization of the immigration status\n\nof public figures,\n\nit's going to reshape this country for all of us.\n\nAnd at Wired, we're gonna be watching.\n\nI'm Vittoria Elliot, thanks for watching On The Grid.\n\n[dramatic music]",
