  "text": "The heavyweights of Hollywood made their cases on Thursday to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a prize that they hope will help them outflank their competitors in the streaming wars.\n\nNetflix, Paramount and Comcast submitted bids to acquire the Hollywood colossus, which owns the Warner Bros. movie studio, HBO, and cable networks like CNN and TNT, four people with knowledge of the proposals said.\n\nThe outcome of the sale could alter the trajectory of the entertainment business.\n\nDavid Ellison, the Paramount chief executive armed with billions from his father, wants to combine all of Warner Bros. Discovery with Paramount to create a counterweight to tech giants. Comcast, the owner of NBC, wants the company’s studio and streaming business, with many iconic characters like Batman, to help elevate its digital business and theme parks. Netflix, which has always been seen as an outside disrupter, is also eyeing the studio and streaming business — a deal that would put it in control of a classic film library and a major studio lot.\n\nEach bidder recently made a pitch to Warner Bros. Discovery about why it is the ideal suitor.\n\nComcast’s bid would create a formidable contender at the box office, combining two of the largest movie studios — Warner Bros. and Universal — as well as creating a home entertainment juggernaut that included HBO Max and Peacock, two prominent streaming services.",
