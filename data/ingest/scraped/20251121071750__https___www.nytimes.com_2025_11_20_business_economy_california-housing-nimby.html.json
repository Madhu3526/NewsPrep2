  "text": "One way or the other, the answer was going to be yes.\n\nWhen Leo Pustilnikov filed an application in 2023 with the City of Beverly Hills to build a 19-story apartment tower with a hotel, the developer didn’t care that it flouted the zoning code or that the City Council was unanimously opposed to the project or that neighbors had described it as a “monstrosity.” He had the city backed into a corner and wasn’t going to pretend otherwise.\n\n“My philosophy is always this: If I can work with a city, I’m more than happy to,” Mr. Pustilnikov said. “When a city doesn’t want to help, I have no problem ignoring them and doing it my way.”\n\nThis was not the way business was normally done in Beverly Hills, a famously wealthy enclave where development is tightly controlled. It’s a tough place to build. Land is expensive, labor is expensive and NIMBYism — the not-in-my-backyard sentiment that exists everywhere — is particularly strong. The city’s zoning rules discourage projects that are tall and bulky and that might anger the owners of single-family houses nearby. Five stories is the tallest allowable height for a multifamily residential building — and those are permitted on only a few blocks of the city.",
