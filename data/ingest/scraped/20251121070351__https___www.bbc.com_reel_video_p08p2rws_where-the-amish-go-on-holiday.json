  "title": "Where the Amish go on holiday",
  "text": "Photographer Dina Litovsky has been photographing the Amish on holiday since 2018. Hailing from as far as Indiana or Ohio, Amish and Mennonite families come to Pinecraft, Florida to spend their time off.\n\nDuring the days and sometimes months that they spend together, they relax rules and come into contact with other Anabaptist communities.\n\nThrough a special access to these communities, Litovsky explores their relationship to leisure and their interactions with Florida locals.",
