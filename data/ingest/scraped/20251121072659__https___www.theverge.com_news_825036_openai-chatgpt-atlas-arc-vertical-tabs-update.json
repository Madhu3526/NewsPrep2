  "text": "is a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nOpenAI is updating ChatGPT Atlas with vertical tabs that make it look a bit like the Arc browser. Now, instead of opening a new tab at the top of the AI-powered browser, you can change your tab style to access it within a left-hand sidebar.\n\nSimilar to Arc, you can resize the sidebar on ChatGPT Atlas, as well as reorder your tabs. The new sidebar still isn’t as full-featured as Arc’s, however, and the address bar remains at the top of your screen. You can try out vertical tabs on ChatGPT Atlas by right-clicking inside the address bar, hovering over “Tab Style,” and then choosing “Vertical Tabs.”\n\nAlong with this change, you can now set Google as your default search engine, which makes sense since using the browser sometimes feels like Googling with extra steps. Otherwise, ChatGPT Atlas will present you with around 10 relevant sources it found across the web, with a link to Google Search results in the top-right corner of the screen.\n\nSome other updates include the ability to select and drag multiple tabs by holding down Command or Shift and clicking. You can also import your extensions from your existing browser when downloading Atlas, though this feature isn’t yet available for existing users. There’s an improved downloads interface as well, in addition to support for iCloud keychain passkeys.\n\nChatGPT Atlas launched on macOS last month, becoming the newest addition to AI-enabled browsing experiences alongside Perplexity’s Comet and Google’s Gemini extension in Chrome. With ChatGPT Atlas, you can either enter a URL or type in a question that will be answered by ChatGPT. You can view the full list of changes on OpenAI’s website.",
