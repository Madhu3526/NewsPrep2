  "text": "Let’s be real, you’ve probably played Vampire Survivors. The “reverse bullet hell” game from Poncle has been a wild success since its Early Access release in 2021, and has steadily grown ever since, adding everything from co-op, to unexpected crossovers, to full-on expansions. But today, Poncle went further than we could have expected – in the latest Xbox Partner Preview broadcast, we got a world premiere for an entirely new spin-off game: Vampire Crawlers.\n\nComing to Xbox next year (and releasing day one with Xbox Game Pass Premium and Ultimate), Vampire Crawlers is a dungeon-crawling roguelike deckbuilder, built within the same world as Survivors – sharing characters, items, even in-jokes, but in an entirely new genre. After picking a Crawler (each a returning Vampire Survivors character, with distinct sets of abilities), you’ll explore dungeons, build and customize decks of attacks and utilities, and take part in high-speed, high-chaos card battles. As you’d hope from this studio, it can get absolutely wild.\n\nI’ve been lucky enough to see a little more of the game than was shown in the trailer, and even luckier to speak to Poncle founder & CEO, Luca about how this new game came about, what exactly we have in store, and much more.",
