  "text": "Two weeks ago, Fátima Bosch of Mexico walked out of an official Miss Universe event in protest after she was scolded by an organizer. On Friday, she walked across the stage as the 74th winner of one of the world’s most prestigious beauty pageants.\n\nHer coronation on Friday marked the end of two weeks of competition that were marred by accusations that it was rigged and rare protests by contestants, including Ms. Bosch.\n\nMs. Bosch, 25, is the fourth Mexican woman to become Miss Universe. She was heavily favored to win the competition, tied in the betting markets with Praveenar Singh of Thailand.\n\nDuring the pageant’s final round in Bangkok on Friday morning, a judge asked Ms. Bosch how she would create a safe space for women as Miss Universe.",
