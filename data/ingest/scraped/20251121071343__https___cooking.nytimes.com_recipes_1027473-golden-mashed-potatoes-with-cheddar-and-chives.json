  "title": "Golden Mashed Potatoes With Cheddar and Chives Recipe",
  "text": "Stained with turmeric and run through with heavy-handed additions of dairy, these potatoes don’t play it safe. Turmeric tints the cream an almost glowing gold, and a heap of sharp white Cheddar melts straight into the mix, giving it both body and tang. They’re rich, yes, but not one-note, as the chives (or scallions, if that’s what you’ve got) cut through with a clean, oniony freshness. The only real rule here is to make sure you drain your potatoes quite well before combining them with your seasonings. Waterlogged potatoes will never absorb all that spiced cream and cheese, and you’ll be left with glue instead of mash. Beyond that, don’t overthink it: Mash them with a spoon or a masher, your weapon of choice. Perfection isn’t the goal, comfort is.",
