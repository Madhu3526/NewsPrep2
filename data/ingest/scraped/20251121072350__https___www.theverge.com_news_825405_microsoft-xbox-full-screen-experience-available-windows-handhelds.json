The full screen mode for the Xbox app originally shipped on the Xbox Ally devices last month, providing a more console-like navigation experience on top of Windows 11.\n\nWhile Microsoft released a preview to MSI Claw models last month, it’s now making the Xbox Full Screen Experience generally available to all Windows-based handhelds. Microsoft is also expanding Xbox FSE “to more Windows 11 PC form factors through the Xbox and Windows Insider programs soon.”\n\nThe Xbox Full Screen Experience running on an Xbox Ally X.

It’s essentially not loading the Explorer shell and saving around 2GB of memory by suppressing all the unnecessary parts of a typical Windows 11 installation.\n\nIf you decide to enable Xbox FSE on your handheld or PC, it will launch you straight into the Xbox PC app at boot, which includes all of your PC games from the Microsoft Store, Battle.net, Steam, and other storefronts. There’s also a Game Bar for navigating between games and launchers, and a task view that’s designed to be more handheld-friendly.\n\nTo turn on Xbox FSE on a compatible handheld, go to Settings > Gaming > Full screen experience, then select Xbox as your home app.",
