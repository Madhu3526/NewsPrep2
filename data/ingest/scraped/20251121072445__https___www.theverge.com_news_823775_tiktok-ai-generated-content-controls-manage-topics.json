  "text": "is a news editor with over a decade’s experience in journalism. He previously worked at Android Police and Tech Advisor.\n\nPosts from this author will be added to your daily email digest and your homepage feed.\n\nTikTok is testing a new control that will let users manage how much AI-generated content appears in their video feed on the app. To help make the filter more effective, the app will also soon start adding invisible watermarks to AI content.\n\nThe new AI slider will appear along with TikTok’s other content controls under “Manage topics,” which currently allows users to set how much they want to see from content areas including dance, current affairs, and fitness. Just like those sliders, the AI control will allow users to request to see more or less AI material, with two levels in either direction.\n\nAn AI slider will only work if TikTok itself knows which content is made with AI, so it’s working on improving detection too. Recognizing that users often remove visual watermarks from AI-generated content, the company will start adding invisible watermarks to content made with its own tools like AI Editor Pro, along with any videos uploaded with C2PA Content Credentials — an industry-wide authentication standard, albeit one that has already shown its limits.\n\nTikTok says both changes are rolling out over “the coming weeks,” though the AI content control is only a test for now.",
