  "text": "So, this wasn’t nearly as bad as some reviews made it sound. The prep was definitely on the longer side, but once it hit the oven, it was a simple “set it and forget it” situation. Bake, weigh it down, cool, and then into the fridge — easy enough. I made a few tweaks along the way. I peeled the potatoes first, soaked them in cold water, then ran them through a mandoline before letting them sit in the cream and butter mixture. I held back a bit on the salt but added fresh garlic for flavor and a fun little twist — thin slices of prosciutto tucked into two of the middle layers. The two-hour cook time was right on the mark, though the cooling stage before refrigeration took a bit longer than expected. All in all, it turned out beautifully — crisp Parmesan crust, creamy layered center, and that subtle hit of prosciutto running through made it feel a bit more elevated. Definitely worth the effort.\n\nIs this helpful? 3",
