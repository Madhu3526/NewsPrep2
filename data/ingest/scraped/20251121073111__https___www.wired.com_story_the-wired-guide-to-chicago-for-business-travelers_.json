  "text": "Chicago always has something to prove. When it went up against New York for the 1893 World's Fair, a New York Sun reporter called out its \"windbag\" campaigners. Illinois ended up hosting the fair, and Chicago embraced its new identity as the Windy City. That chip-on-the-shoulder energy still defines this metropolis, a city that builds, innovates, and competes like it has everything to lose.\n\nChicago’s tech scene is a diverse landscape that shouldn’t be slept on—but you probably know that. Over the past decade, the Second City’s tech sector has grown by 18 percent, adding more than 106,000 direct jobs and nearly 150,000 indirect jobs, according to the Chicagoland Chamber of Commerce. The city’s universities produce more computer science graduates than anywhere else in the country. Giants like Google, Salesforce, and Meta have expanded here, while startups like Tegus, Uber Freight, and G2 have relocated from Silicon Valley, drawn by Chicago’s talent pool and more affordable cost of living.\n\nChicago's tech scene is not siloed; nearly half of all tech positions are tied to core industries like health care, finance, and logistics. In August, the TechChicago conference spotlighted quantum computing, energy-efficient data centers, and equitable access to capital, demonstrating that Chicago is thinking about how technology can enhance everyday life.\n\nTo be in Chicago is to work hard, play harder. Dinner in Fulton Market, drinks on the Riverwalk, and a comedy set to close out the night.\n\nWhere to Stay\n\nWhile Chicago’s tech scene spans the city, chances are your work trip landed you somewhere in the Loop, River North, or West Loop area. Our lodgings keep you close, comfortable, and surrounded by fellow professionals.\n\nCourtesy of The St. Regis Chicago\n\n363 E. Wacker Drive, (312) 787-3447\n\nWhere the Chicago River and Lake Michigan meet, the St. Regis delivers the city’s pinnacle of luxury, complete with a world-class spa, fitness facilities, and acclaimed dining. The Signature Butler Service takes care of unpacking, suit pressing, shoe shines, and morning coffee (or tea), so you can focus on the business that brought you here. A complimentary house car can get you to nearby meetings or lunches within a 2-mile radius. Start with the Tokyo Breakfast at Japanese restaurant Miru, return at 5 pm for the hotel’s daily champagne sabrage, then head to Tre Dita for handmade pasta and Tuscan wood-fired steaks—be sure to reserve ahead.\n\n200 N Green St., (312) 761-1700\n\nIf you want a hotel that feels like part of the city, it’s the Hoxton in the West Loop. Check in and out anytime when you book directly. Workspaces are available, from library desks to coworking spaces and meeting rooms. If you’re hungry, the on-site café serves Aya Bakery pastries and coffee, and if you need a break, daybeds await, which are ideal for a power nap or nursing a hangover. Weather permitting, their outdoor terraces double as another place to get work done. You don’t even have to leave the Hoxton to hit the neighborhood’s hottest dining and drinking spots; Cira serves Mediterranean-inspired eats all day, Cabra Cevicheria dishes Peruvian bites on the rooftop, head downstairs to Lazy Bird for cocktails and live music Thursday through Saturday, and Milk Bar is also in-house for a late-night sugar fix.\n\nCourtesy of The Emily Hotel\n\n311 N Morgan St., (312) 764-1919\n\nIn Fulton Market, the Emily Hotel is perfect for travelers who want a local vibe with all the luxuries and tech conveniences. Grab a coffee at the in-house coffee bar, lunch at Fora, cocktails at rooftop bar Selva, and dinner at Sushi by Bou. Stay active in the 24/7 fitness center, and if the weather permits, catch a film at the hotel’s terrace cinema.\n\n900 E Grand, (872) 710-5700\n\nAt Sable, you’ll have everything you need for an enjoyable stay. Grab a coffee in the lobby at Kisbi, where single-origin beans from Costa Rica, Kenya, and Ethiopia make your morning feel instantly richer. Lirica, the Spanish- and Iberian-inspired restaurant, is perfect for a solo lunch or team dinner. The Offshore Rooftop has unbeatable views of the skyline and Lake Michigan, plus a full-service bar. As for amenities, there’s a 24-hour fitness center, meeting rooms if you need to get work done, and, of course, Navy Pier itself just outside your door—full shops, restaurants, and attractions to keep you entertained. It’s a bit like living in a mall.\n\nCourtesy of InterContinental Chicago\n\n505 N Michigan Ave., (312) 944-4100\n\nIn the heart of the Magnificent Mile, the InterContinental blends big-city business energy with old-school glamour. That’s partially thanks to its indoor pool, a 1929 stunner tiled in Spanish Majolica and watched over by a terracotta Neptune fountain, floating 14 stories above Michigan Avenue. During the week, you’ll mostly see business travelers, though families often stay here, too. The practical amenities are covered, including meeting rooms, printing services, and even a notary, if needed. There are two on-site restaurants: Casa Chi leans Japanese Peruvian with great cocktails, and Michael Jordan’s Steakhouse is exactly what you think. There’s also a Starbucks in the lobby, but with so many better local cafés nearby, it’s worth wandering out.\n\nWhere to Work\n\nYou can work from any of the hotels on our list, but if you need a change of scenery, Chicago has plenty of coworking options, too. Below are some of our favorites, and Deskpass is a great resource for more options.\n\nPhotograph: Steve Geer/Getty Images\n\n20 N. Wacker Drive, 12th Floor\n\nInside the Civic Opera Building in the city’s business district, this 60,000-square-foot workspace is designed for tech professionals. Fast Wi-Fi, ergonomic setups, meeting rooms, and even a rooftop terrace and fitness center. Drop in for $35 a day on Deskpass.\n\n3130 N Rockwell St.\n\nIn Avondale, Guild Row offers a sunlit workspace with high ceilings, private Zoom booths, and a café and bar for breaks. The Belmont Room hosts workshops, talks, and events, but the overall atmosphere is calm and focused for getting work done without distractions. It’s a space to recharge, meet like-minded people, or settle in for a productive day. You can purchase a day pass for $28.\n\n1821 W Hubbard St Unit 209\n\nIn the West Loop, Art/Work Coworking is a creative lab that draws in the city’s creatives, techies, and freelancers. Open 24/7 with automated access, it offers desks and bookable meeting rooms. Drop in with Deskpass, or book a conference room starting at $50 an hour.\n\nWhere to Get Your Coffee\n\n112 N Green St.\n\nIf you need a reliable off-site work spot, Sawada Coffee has plenty of seats, strong Wi-Fi, and strong coffee. Founded by Japanese barista Hiroshi Sawada, Sawada Coffee is renowned for the Military Latte—a rich jolt of matcha, espresso, and cocoa—but they also have cortados, cappuccinos, and cookies on hand to keep the workflow steady. If you linger into lunch, you don’t have to go far; Sawada shares its space with Green Street Smoked Meats, known for its Central Texas–style barbecue.\n\n714 N Wells St.\n\nOwned by Palestinian American friends, Oud Coffee is a River North favorite for craft lattes and bites. The signature Oud latte blends pistachio syrup, cardamom spice, and fresh mint, while the menu also includes Turkish coffee, tea, and smoothies. Snack on Manakeesh flatbread, stuffed dates, or baklava. Spacious indoor seating makes it a solid spot to catch up on work, or sit outside if the weather permits. There’s another location in Wicker Park, should you find yourself closer to that neighborhood.\n\n5531 N Clark St.\n\nThe Understudy is a theater-bookstore-slash-café, with passion fruit syrup on offer alongside lavender, wild rose petal, and hazelnut. Non-coffee drinkers can sip iced ube lattes, sparkling matcha lemonades, or a lychee roasted goddess tea. Come for the flavor, stay for the creative atmosphere, with light-filled nooks that make it easy to lose an afternoon.\n\n3101 S Morgan St.\n\nBridgeport Coffee has been roasting on the South Side since 2004, and it’s still one of the city’s best stops for a cup of coffee that actually tastes like where it came from. The shop sources beans directly from growers, cutting out middlemen for better flavor and fairer trade. There are only a couple of counter seats and a handful of tables, but it’s a cozy place to work if you snag a spot.\n\nWhere to Eat\n\nChances are, Chicago’s hottest eateries will be booked solid, but we’ve found the sweet spots that actually have availability.\n\nCourtesy of Chef’s Special\n\n2165 N Western Ave.\n\nFor a kitschy yet upscale take on the American Chinese takeout you grew up on, Chef’s Special delivers saucy, family-style classics. Think orange chicken, Mongolian beef, and lo mein noodles—fast. The nostalgic comfort food is paired with tropical cocktails, from a lemongrass gimlet to an $8 shot-and-beer combo. Ideal for small teams or clients, the menu encourages sampling, making it less about individual plates and more about the experience.\n\n800 W Randolph St.\n\nAt Au Cheval, Chicago’s über-celebrated burger joint, the melty, egg-topped cheeseburger lives up to its hype. The vibe is low-key, with a diner-meets-French-speakeasy feel, featuring dim lighting, leather booths, and an open kitchen that's always at full capacity. You have to get the cheeseburger, but the chilaquiles and roasted bone marrow are also worth ordering. There are no reservations; swing by on a weekday afternoon, put your name down, and grab a drink at one of Fulton Market’s many bars while you wait.",
