  "title": "Mustardy Sheet-Pan Salmon With Greens Recipe",
  "text": "Not for me. Love sheet pan dinners and salmon and roasted greens, but the mustard mixture did not appeal. The sauce was too sweet and the flavors didn't come together, they just clanged together on my tongue. I did depart from the recipe by using kale, which I recommend as it did hold up to this cooking method. I also tossed some asparagus that needed used up onto the pan, which worked well. At the end, I broiled the salmon for 3 min after removing the veg but it didn't help the sauce.\n\nIs this helpful?",
