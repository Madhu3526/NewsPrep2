  "text": "This easy chicken sheet-pan supper brings bold, warming flavors with minimal fuss. Tossed with ras el hanout, the chicken roasts alongside potatoes, sweet peppers and chickpeas, creating a richly flavored dish that practically makes its own sauce. The sheet pan may look crowded, but everything melts beautifully together as it cooks. The peppers, potatoes and chickpeas simmer gently in the oil, while the chicken sits halfway in, its skin staying crispy as the juices mingle below. Any chickpeas peeking out get delightfully crisp, while the rest confit in the oil, becoming soft and smooth. A finishing drizzle of sherry vinegar adds a bright, tangy kick, balancing the warm spices and bringing out the dish’s deep roasted flavours. Best of all, the prep is simple, and the oven does the rest, making this perfect for a cozy midweek dinner that still feels special.",
