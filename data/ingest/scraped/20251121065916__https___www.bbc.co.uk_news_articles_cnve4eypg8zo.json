  "text": "The owner of a cocktail and karaoke bar where solo drinkers are banned says he is baffled by the furore it has caused on social media as the policy is \"for the safety of all guests\".\n\nCarl Peters said the no-single-entry policy after 21:00 had been in place since the opening of Alibi in Altrincham, Greater Manchester, in 2022.\n\nHe told the BBC it was to \"mitigate risk\" and \"protect his customers\" from being \"mithered\" by solo drinkers.\n\nHe posted a reel on Instagram earlier this month about the policy after saying someone had accused him of discrimination. He said he was \"astounded\" by the ensuing criticism, describing his venue as an \"inclusive and safe environment\".",
