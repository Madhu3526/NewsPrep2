  "text": "Gemini will replace Google Assistant in Android Auto, the smartphone projection technology integrated into millions of cars, trucks, and SUVs. Google announced the move Thursday, noting that Gemini will start to roll out to Android Auto users who have upgraded from Google Assistant to Gemini on their phone.\n\nBy bringing Gemini to Android Auto, Google is making it possible for users to speak naturally and have a back-and-forth conversation to complete more complex tasks on the go, according to the company. Android Auto is an app that runs on a user’s phone and wirelessly communicates and projects features like navigation, music, and messaging from an Android-based smartphone to the car’s display.\n\nThe rollout doesn’t come as a surprise, as the change is part of Google’s plans to replace Google Assistant with Gemini across all of its devices and platforms. The company announced in May that Gemini would be coming to Android Auto this year.\n\nWith Gemini, users can ask questions about businesses along their route to find something specific. For example, users could ask something like: “Hey, Google, I need your help. I’m suddenly craving barbecue. Any good spots along my route that are open now, near my destination?” If a spot looks interesting, Gemini can offer more information about the place, such as details about the restaurant’s most popular dish or whether the establishment is dog-friendly.\n\nImage Credits:Google\n\nUsers can also reply to messages with Gemini and get summaries of texts. For instance, you can ask Gemini to let your friend know that you’re stuck in traffic and to add your ETA to the message. Or, you can ask Gemini to translate a message into a different language before sending it.\n\nGemini also lets users access their emails in Gmail while driving. For example, a user could ask something like: “I have a hotel booked for tonight. I think the address is in my email. Can you check and navigate there?” Gemini can also give you a summary of your unread emails.\n\nGoogle notes that Gemini can help people get the right soundtrack for a drive by asking it to create a playlist with specific instructions such as, “Can you give me a road trip playlist? Ideally something upbeat, about 3 hours long, that’s good for both me and the kids.” This works with streaming services like YouTube Music, Spotify, and more.\n\nTechcrunch event Join the Disrupt 2026 Waitlist Add yourself to the Disrupt 2026 waitlist to be first in line when Early Bird tickets drop.

Can you be my tour guide and share some fun facts about it?” And then follow up with further instructions: “Thanks for teaching me all about St. Louis. Changing topics, the rehearsal dinner is at his parents house, and I’d like to get them a small something. What are some good ideas?”\n\nGemini begins rolling out on Android Auto globally starting Thursday in 45 languages.\n\nTo access it, you need to make sure you’re using the Gemini app on your phone. You’ll see a tooltip on your car display once it’s available for you. To use it, you need to say, “Hey, Google” and then press the mic button on your car screen or long press the voice control button on your steering wheel.",
