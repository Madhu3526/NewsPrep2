I managed to stretch it as far as I could, because I'd been quite conservative with how I was doing.\"\n\nEven so, the mortgage arrears on his two-bedroom flat eventually grew to about £13,000 and his bank said if that figure was not reduced to below £8,000 it would seek to repossess his home.\n\nTo scrape by, he has turned to selling off his possessions on an internet auction site and accepting a loan from a friend.",
