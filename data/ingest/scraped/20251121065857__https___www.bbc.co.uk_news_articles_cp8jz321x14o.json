  "text": "\"I am waiting for the bailiff to knock on the door, take my keys and kick me out,\" says Jose Da Costa Diogo, one of thousands of people who have been told this year their homes will be repossessed.\n\nThe 65-year-old learned he would lose his home in Thetford, Norfolk, during a brisk 10-minute county court hearing earlier this year.\n\nThe interest-only mortgage on the three-bedroom property was taken out more than 20 years ago in the hope he and his then wife would save up enough to eventually cover the capital sum.\n\nBut the collapse of the marriage and his ex-wife's departure to Brazil in 2015, left Mr Da Costa Diogo unable to repay the £80,000 still outstanding.\n\nAnd because his ex-wife was still on both the mortgage documents and the property deeds, he was also unable to sell the property to cover the outstanding amount.\n\n\"I tried to do the right thing and carried on paying all the bills,\" he said. \"After 25 years, I have nothing to show... but I still have to carry on living.\n\n\"I'm going to be homeless.\"",
